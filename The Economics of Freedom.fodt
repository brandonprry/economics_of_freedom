   <text:p text:style-name="Standard"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="Standard"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="Standard">PREFACE</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Standard"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="Standard">To those who are prepared to take a partially disguised dose of economic argument it is perhaps a kindness to say that Part II, The Essentials of a Remedy, may be read first, before concerning themselves with the groundwork of the theory, as stated more fully in Part I, upon which this tentative program is based. However, since the theory itself deals with the economics of freedom , and not the politico economics of thwarted welfare, which men have tried so vainly to reconcile with good sense, it is not as much a re<text:span text:style-name="T1">c</text:span>ital of ritual as might be apprehended : it deals with freedom , not with output: with value not with goods.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Standard"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="Standard">If, in attempting to fit together a simple and logical structure, very little attention has been paid to a great deal of the available material so ably gathered by my predecessors, this is due to the self-imposed obligation of utilizing only what is measurable in some basic terms, upon the assumption that the science of economics is primarily concerned with measurement.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Standard"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="Standard">If, further, it seems presumptuous, uncharitable or irreverent to question the tireless activities of the political- economists who would so often hit the nail squarely upon the head -- if only it had not moved -- it should be apparent that whatever shadow of criticism there may be falls much more nearly on those who so <text:span text:style-name="T1">dexterously</text:span> move it. And yet this is only an appearance of censoriousness. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P1"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P1">&quot; No villain need be ! . . . . </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P1">&quot;We are betray&apos;d by what is false within .&quot; </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P1"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P1">The writer is conscious of only one clear prejudice, and that lies, not against any individual or group, but against an attempt to measure by means of unmeasurable factors,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P1">since equity , justice , security , value -- and freedom itself are vain words until we devise an unimpairable measure. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P1"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P1">Under democracy we enjoy the full political privileges of sovereign citizens; and if there is any blame to be apportioned by us, it rests, beyond shadow of doubt, upon our own shoulders. To attempt to measure value without any consideration of the cost of overcoming resistance is a pathetic survival of bondage. And to sanction , as we do today, impenetrable international barriers to goods and services, while we grant to gold all the privileges of an ambassador and boast of it - is to invite the world &apos;s most able men to deal in this dominating commodity. If these are wrongly reproached on any score , surely the most wrongful of reproaches would be to assert that they fail to utilize the most effective medium for their imperial operations.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P1"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3">There are only two explicit adjustments suggested. One is to make taxation scientific and impersonal -- and then forget it. The other is to construct a basic and unimpairable measure of value and then employ it, not as a thing of value, but as an entirely unprejudiced means of recording justly the sensitive, critical and vital human appraisements of goods, services, facilities, culture and order which give them value. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3">In the last analysis there is only one adjustment suggested : this is to put the purely mechanical problems of taxation and currency deliberately under our feet, or, in other words, to disentangle from the necessary mechanism of our economic system , its dynamic value- which is individual freedom .</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P1">To venture into a field where the claims of the academicians now actually overlap would be rash , if it were not for very generous encouragement such as that held out by one of the most judicial of recent investigators :</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Standard"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="Standard">&quot; The misery and squalor that surround us, the dying fire</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P3">of hope in many millions of European homes, the injurious luxury of some wealthy families, the terrible uncertainty overshadowing many families of the poor -- these are evils too plain to be ignored . By the knowledge that our science seeks it is possible that they may be restrained . Out of the darkness light! To search for it is the task , to find it, perhaps,the prize, which the &apos;dismal science of Political-Economy&apos; offers to those who face its discipline.&quot; * </text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P4"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4">In case any reader is sufficiently concerned to be critical, it should be stated that the following contribution to economic theory was commenced in 1916 and completed in 1923, so that it has had to reckon with periods of boom , depression and partial recovery. As a consequence, while the initial conviction is unaltered, namely , that the problem of economics is the measurement of the freedom , or value, which arises from effective human effort, nevertheless, the contemporary data has, unquestionably , been colored by the acuteness of the recent economic changes. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4">Owing to the pressure of other work, there have been fairly long intervals in the argument, and these, as far as the writer is concerned , have necessitated frequent returns to the starting-point. While this results in a certain amount of repetition , it may not be entirely disadvantageous, since the average reader of economics usually finds it even more difficult to give his sustained attention to the sequence of the logic than did the author.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Standard"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="Standard">In addition to these flaws, the writing itself has been accomplished under some difficulties : on river-boats in China ; on inter-island steamers in the Philippines; under badly patched mosquito nets in equatorial islands; on the decks of sailing vessels in the Sulu and Celebes Seas, with sharp interruptions when it was necessary to go about; on government operated railroads in Australia (which stimulate thinking much more than writing ) ; and in the smoking-rooms of many ocean liners, which , after all, are excellent laboratories , and may be earnestly recommended to any political-economist who is in danger of losing touch with actualities, since there is an opportunity of contact with exceedingly competent economic observers - diplomats, bankers, planters , merchants and engineers -- who, day after day, on the long Pacific run , put forward most significant economic testimony, even while</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4">they protest that they know nothing of economics.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4">Just as the intervals in time have provided some highly contrasting data to test the theory, so also have the long intervals in miles. To have seen the &quot; fabricated captain &quot; of a United States Shipping Board vessel permitting his sailors to recline in deck chairs and farm out the work of swabbing decks to native muchachos in the port of Cebu ; to have seen markets for produce established in remote islands, the inhabitants of which practiced communism and were accustomed to be swept by famine, and to witness the development of a sense of property -rights and a prompt demand for barbed wire; to have seen the end of a century-long factional guild -war in China, and an immediate drop in the quality of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Standard">the non -competitive output, following the practical establishment of a monopoly ; to see at home, the American dairyman , as a producer of milk , cheerfully buying foreign oil-cake instead of American grain ; and, as a manufacturer of butter , fighting bitterly against the importation of the oil expressed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Standard">from this cake; and to have seen the American grain farmer, during the last few years, driven steadily into debt through indirect taxation , and hesitating over the cost of his pipe tobacco ;- all these things are valid economic data , which must be taken into consideration in the formulation of any rational economic theory .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Standard"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="Standard">From the impersonal standpoint of science, all economic logic, since the advent of representative government, has been vitiated by one elementary mathematical error: it has not yet been clearly realized that economic value has an essential inverse component.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="Standard"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="Standard">It is , therefore, impossible to construct a scientific measure of value until this inverse component -- the cost of overcoming resistance -- can be mathematically included in our calculations. If this contention is correct (and it would be sheer impudence to put it forward to any scientist other than an economist ) , <text:soft-page-break/>then a host of so- called political complications can be removed from economics; and it is on this one contention that the following contribution to economic theory stands or falls. </text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>INTRODUCTION</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4">The following essays are an attempt to draw a dividing line (upon paper , at any rate ) between politics and economics, by which politics, as now practiced, is set aside for serious attention as a likely factor of friction ,while economics is isolated as a logical science dealing, under democracy, with the measurement of liberated human effort. Such a divorce leaves the art of politics with all the advantages of a going-concern at the moment; and the science of economics is withdrawn so far from immediate possible application that some difficulty may be experienced in imagining any renewed relationship.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P4">For democracy, politics, as a means of obtaining sectional democracy is the protection of our reopened ways for the sake of individual freedom , and this policy must be maintained with a definite regard for dynamic law if it is to be of any general advantage. During the long and costly struggle for individual freedom the desperate maneuvering we have known as &quot; politics&quot; has been a reaction - induced and defensive-- against arbitrary interference with the free functioning of the individual. The campaign started as a fight for general freedom as opposed to autocratic privilege ; but the militantly disposed, after their habit, have not laid down their arms with victory, and they continue to parade, competing among themselves for hardworking citizens who were ready to make use of their</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">liberty , if they had been permitted.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot; Political-economy&quot; was a thoroughly well-justified name for the baffling study of economic resultants impaired by irresponsible autocratic policies. Between the lines of old works on political-economy may be read implied strictures (which could not be made openly ) upon autocratic manipulation ; and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the friendly relationship of the political-economist to the Court was seriously affected if the criticism were sufficiently obvious to be comprehended. This was a very bad start for the literary technique of economics. Political-economy recognized that we were stiff with bandages and bore much the same relation to economics that an advertisement for embrocation bears to anatomy. The political-economist, however, is fully warranted , today, in turning his attention to the international field where he may study the effect of political motives upon the logical consequences of economic law , since, internationally, arbitrary barriers to free flow are still sanctioned. As long as we and other nations are interested in economic preserves, so long will it be necessary to have well-armed gamekeepers and so long will it be impossible to measure values by the logical flow of unimpeded human effort in a measurable zone of order.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Within the boundaries of democracy, what is now called the &quot; Science of Economics,&quot; owing to the coercive (or purely short-sighted ) policies of multitudinous state -bureaus, is again political-economy and is dismal because it is hopelessly incoherent. Ely recognizes this renewed misalliance with a note</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which is somewhere between acquiescence and satisfaction , when he states : 1 &quot; But in treating economics in connection with ethics and politics, the older writers were merely following an instinctive method of dealing with economic truths to which in a certain degree later writers are returning.&quot; It may seem a little unkind to mention it, but there can be nothing either ethical or politic about a science.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5">The rational science of economics -- the measuring of the value of liberated human effort within definite limits, and the consequent identification of costly friction - has not, apparently, been presented, or conceived , as a whole . Much of the available data has been ably assembled ; but if there has been any attempt to show the possibility of correlating such data , as in any other science dealing with the measurement of energy, it is difficult to discover, or to discover any trace of its influence . </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5">Why, unless there is some basic confusion in the so -called</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">science of economics, does everyone but a professional economist shy from it, unless it is that thinking men instinctively</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">insist on logical structure, or unvarying foundations capable of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">supporting such a structure ? This general lack of interest is not exhibited in other sciences ; but wage-earners, farmers, traders, manufacturers and bankers, who must all suffer</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sooner or later the consequences of poor economic engineering, still dodge the professional economist, likable as he may be, as ball , though he were a dogmatic theologian.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5">Let us take the most urgent problems to which the science of economics should be applied , namely , those of taxation, the basic insurance of order ; of value, the consequence of effort within a region of order ; and of currency, the measure of this value. We now have taxation based upon need , effort and ability , in intricate and arbitrary ratios ; while value is tied tightly, and currency loosely, to gold , first, because gold was originally regarded as more stable in quantity than the good faith of some irresponsible autocrat, and, second, because go<text:span text:style-name="T2">ld </text:span>is even more malleable than we dreamed and has, under the political exigencies of democracy, a capacity for being beaten very thin and used for gilding in times of scarcity . As against these deplorable survivals of political bondage, we have the general knowledge that taxation is the pro rata responsibility of dispersed sovereignty for order : that order is a prerequisite of value ; while the device of currency is clearly an attempt to measure the resulting value and make it negotiable , or, in other words, to provide that the freedom which arises from effective effort should have equal weight in time and space within our national domain . </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5">Fundamentally, then , currency, value and taxation are integrally related, since currency is a measure of value, and value is a consequence of effort, modified by the cost of order ; and yet, today, the volume of our currency is governed by a small and uncontrollable sum of gold ;while taxation is imposed upon effort, which it tends ultimately to diminish . Such considerations as these force one to realize that some of the accepted rudiments of scientific method are absent from much that is termed economics. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P5">To gain a hearing in a field where there is no audience and a long list of speakers is a difficult problem ; and the method may strike the orthodox as unprofessional, since detail is eliminated as far as possible, and an effort has been made to avoid technicalities. An attempt has also been made to gain some advantage by endeavoring to keep the auditors awake, though this the orthodox may regard as hardly ethical. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">The program followed is designed to show that all our conceptions of value were logically &quot; faulted&quot; by the movement which we called revolution , and which we misguidedly thought was emancipation . We moved , unfortunately, in mass, without much rearrangement of our economic strata .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The salient points are as follows :</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">( I) A brief survey is made of the confusion of democracy , which is still governed by the short- sighted desires of various strongly -organized political groups . Owing to a lack of any scientific conception of measurement, democracy has not reformulated the tentative economic laws put forward by the unfortunate political-economist in the days when it was illegal</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">to think that kings might be an incubus:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">(II) Consideration is next given to the apparent conflict of interest between the community and the individual-- the com munity being concerned with order and general facilities, the prerequisites of <text:soft-page-break/>value, and the individual with personal freedom (the logical consequence of liberated effort in a region of order ), which is value itself :</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">(III) Upon the assumption that an unimpairable pledge, or token , of value is an essential inducement of effort, a search is conducted for the measurable limits of value, so that the causes for the continual diminishment of our present unit may be discerned and dealt with :</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">(IV ) An examination is made of the fundamental significance of the words &quot; order &quot; and &quot; value&quot; which , in economics (not in physics), we have continued to employ very lightly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">since we broke away from a system in which both order and value were spoon - fed to the simple -minded subject:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">( V ) A momentary (and possibly useless ) protest is ventured against the deplorable custom of hurling standardized economic epithets at any emergence of reason : </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">(VI) An uncompromising stand has been taken against our dangerous tendency to surrender our freedom of motion to bureaucracy, which is an alarming symptom of our anÊmic</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">abandonment of liberty ; and , finally,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">( VII) A very regretful admission is made that while economic law is universal there are few nations, if any, that do not elect to remain economic outlaws.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Our conception of economics is so badly complicated by inherited errors, and now so involved in the consequences of short-sighted bureaucratic remedies, that any attempt to disentangle ourselves may appear purely academic. The effort is made, however, with the hope that we may, as a preparatory step, disentangle ourselves mentally. For this reason the assurance of some of the following assertions is the assurance of the theorist who has reason to believe he is right, and puts for ward his data for expert examination not the assurance of the reformer who has neither data nor doubt.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It is not urged at the moment that our economic maladjustment can be straightened out. Layer upon layer of custom have entrapped individuals and communities-- each layer em bracing its own crystallized inequities and errors, together with their corresponding ameliorations and adjustments. Within this highly stratified politico -economic structure we may possibly maintain a diminishing consciousness of contact and life for a long time to come; but it is interesting to contemplate the likelihood that much of our so -called stability is due to increasing pressure and the multiplication of thoughtlessly erected barriers to free motion. If no intelligent easing of the strain is feasible under democracy, we may, in spite of our hopes, have to face the possibility that social evolution itself is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">catastrophic.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The tracing and elucidation of the origin of human habits, of shrewd elimination and of invention, may be still left grate fully to the historian , who has a noble and inspiring task of his own, and who has thrown , for the economist, much light upon the gradual disentanglement of the individual by our collective absorption or casting out of interference. The historian has already told us, if we will read imaginatively , the nature and use of economic value ; but no exploration of the sources can solve our immediate problem of liberating this value and then measuring it in tangible terms, so as to make our tokens incapable of debasement with relation to the whole. The historian may retrace the sequence of the swelling stream of value ; but he cannot interpret the present in terms of the past ; for this stream has undergone two vital changes: it has e<text:span text:style-name="T3">x</text:span>perienced the breaking-up of the medieval ice - jams; and it now flows within the definite walls of national area.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The period of snow and ice came logically to an end with the advent of representative government. Democracy is now our new channel for human effort, - a channel which can unquestionably be swept clear of obstructions, so as to meet the passionate human desire for individual freedom . &quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>To the economist falls the simple yet exacting task of that unimpeachable measurement of the value of effective human effort by its dominating limits which is the only sound basis for future operations, if economic freedom is to be made possible</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">within the well-defined confines of democracy.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The main theory -- the continuous thread which runs through the following essays - should not be difficult to trace. The bare sequence may be stated as follows: </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">Democracy, in the uncolored terms of science, is the result of a steadily growing conviction , within certain limited areas, that friction -- that is,where the free functioning of the individual is subject to least interference. Quite apart from academic considerations, therefore, democracy is interested in the scientific measurement of value for the purpose of devising an unimpairable pledge or token of value that will serve as an inducement of effort, since coercion has been eliminated . The only certain inducement of effort is a guarantee that it will command at any time and at any place, within a given area, at least equal effort. Such a guarantee we would be justified in calling a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">measure of value. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">Value may therefore be regarded as the equivalent of effective effort ; and , following scientific procedure , is directly proportional to initial effort and inversely proportional to the resistance of the area in which it is exerted . Total economic value may consequently be expressed as the ratio between total initial effort and total basic resistance within any given area . If this ratio is to be resolved so as to give us an answer in tangible terms, both effort and the cost of overcoming resistance, or</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">taxation , must be expressed by means of the same common de nominator. In this way the national conception of freedom ( the sum of all individual conceptions of freedom ) , which gives rise to effort,and the national conception of order ( the compromise arising from all individual conceptions of order ) , which makes effort effective, together determine what we call economic value. If this is regarded as unity and measured in terms of area and population -density , then any fractional part of this will remain always constant with relation to the whole.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">If we attempt to measure economic value in terms of gold we express arbitrary value.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">If we measure it in terms of commodities we express momentary and partial value.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P6">If we measure it in terms of effort we express gross potential value.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">If we measure it ( as the state- socialists propose ) in terms of order alone, we are very likely to have no effective effort to measure.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Only then by expressing total economic value as the ratio between total liberated effort and the resistance of the area in which it operates can a resultant be obtained which we are scientifically justified in terming value.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">All that is proposed, in the name of science , is that we take into consideration, at the same moment, not only effort, time and area, but also the cost of overcoming resistance. That taxation must be prepaid on the basis of area and population density, is the vital adjustment for which Henry George was groping in the name of equity . If he had realized that land value means nothing till we have a scientific measure of value, he would undoubtedly have made good his contention - since all that he urged vaguely , for the sake of justice, was the prime obligation of the scientist to first take into consideration the basic <text:soft-page-break/>cost of overcoming resistance before any attempt is made to discuss value, or put forward a measure of value.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">There is no assumption in the following pages that human nature can be changed or that it need be changed. It is suggested, however, that if we can boldly retrace our steps from the economic bypaths into which we were ignominiously driven during the dark days of bondage, we may find that the basic human impulse our love of individual freedom _ has much more to do with economic value than we dreamed . All that is proposed is to give this impulse the greatest possible play within the widest possible limits -- but to frankly recognize the limits, since these , without question , are the only things by which we can measure if we care to be guided by scientific precedent.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">CHAPTER I</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">THE AILMENT OF DEMOCRACY</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">THE last few exhausting years have laid bare some latent defects; and perhaps our greatest misfortune is that we have failed to realize them . This failure arises partly from the fact that we have been led to hope for a miraculous cure-all for the whole world which would result incidentally in sudden and permanent well-being for each nation , no matter how organized. It is difficult to understand why the world &apos;s states. men did not meet at Lourdes instead of Versailles.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P7">Within our own borders we have also advocates of miraculous specifics, such as Syndicalism , the Plumb plan , the Shipping Board and High -tariff, who continue to acquiesce in flagrant abuses of the laws of economic hygiene, yet nevertheless lay the blame for the logical consequences of these abuses upon our refusal to employ their particular formulÊ . These reformers, however, actually believe what they preach . </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P7"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P7">The very opposition in the ingredients of these new remedies - like alkalis and acids in the same prescription should make us hesitate : the Guild and the One-Big Union ; Self-determination and a Supreme Council composed in part of representatives of autocratic states ; increased commerce and new barriers to trade ; perpetual peace with greater economic aggression ; all these alternatives are put forward seriously ; and there are many of us so little accustomed to strike a balance between ideals based on immediate advantage and ideals based on ultimate equity that there is a tendency to advocate a trial of the whole contradictory program .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">At the moment we have stopped all housecleaning to listen to advocates of internationalism in one form or another . We are to meet in amity and sleep under the same roof -- but only once</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a year at Geneva ! In the interval there is a new scrutiny of passports, a cashing-in of mandates and a general slamming of doors. It would be amusing if it were not tragic. We have been disastrously diverted from our necessary task of hous<text:span text:style-name="T4">e </text:span>cleaning at a very critical time.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P8">The internationalist, of course , is correct: his dream will come true and would compel our quick sympathy if he did not persist in talking about it before breakfast; but the dream of international amity is not new and was never copyright. It has not been realized because most of us,while willing to cleanse our garments , are not yet ready to cleanse our hearts -- an obvious barrier to enduring peace. If this difficulty could be over come there is still another : It is not yet safe politically or economically for democracy to take &quot; pot-luck &quot; with autocracy .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P8"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P8">It should not be necessary to offend or alienate the internationalist ; but we must not commence our day at the call of chanticleer under the false spell of the moon . The dreamer is ultimately correct ; but it is not because of his dreaming that dawn slowly approaches. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P8"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P8">It is probable that what we call civilization is the progressive modification by man of his environment - his slow attainment of bodily and mental freedom . No international mandate is going to civilize him , for under the most unselfish and competent of trustees, what is likely to be done for a backward race is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to relieve it of the necessity of modifying environment and probably by this very act postpone its maturity. To realize this, it is only necessary to contemplate the American Indian and the Hawaiian, or other immature peoples of the earth, particularly those who fell under the arresting domination of ecclesiastical power with political or politico -economic motives , as in South America .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Now if what we call civilization is the gradual mastery of environment, then various national codes are as unlike as their country of origin . National traits differing from our own should not, therefore, be regarded as gratuitous insults : neither should they be regarded as lending themselves to advantageous</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fusion , since they are undoubtedly the result of effort and selection within that dominating environment which we call &quot; Country.&quot; There is, however , this common sanctity in what different nations call &quot; Country&quot; -- it was at these points in the swirling tides and torrents, that scattered groups of the human family found their foothold and held it by throwing up dikes. While the tearing down of these dikes, urged by the sentimentalist, may contribute a thin thread of color to a historical cross</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P8">section , as a flood takes out a rich field and paints the surface of a submerged delta, this tearing down, until all levels are equally raised , would probably destroy the very seed-beds of culture. If we fully realize the price, we are likely to strengthen the dikes ; for it is no light price in terms of hard-won human liberty ; and it is our sentimentalists who haggle over it with their alternate snatching at self-determination and self-subordination, and with their irrational belief that international peace can be achieved by the compounding of disorder.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P8"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P8">Let us have done with our dream of empty international</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">courtesy and economic impudence, such as has recently put Nauru , Southwest Africa , West Samoa , The Marshalls, The Carolines, The Marianas Islands, and that part of New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago formerly held by Germany, within just such discretionary fences as those with which we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">surround the Philippines, Hawaii and Cuba. If we are deter mined to cling to our exclusive areas of privilege, or are willing to permit our neighbors to cling to theirs, our dream of international peace is simply a dream of regularizing the economic spoils. It is not yet a dream of unity ; but a very practical</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">method of patenting our advantages.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">We have a more immediate task . On no higher a basis than that of urgent self -interest, as champions of democracy, we have plain duties toward our fellow -citizens, toward our international neighbors and toward posterity -- at any rate toward the delightful advance-guard of posterity with which we come in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">contact.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Our duty to our fellow -citizens, apart from any benevolent plans for the future, is to keep faith with those who have labored in the past under the joint-guarantees of democracy ,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and, for the sake of production , to see that these guarantees are kept adequate and respected.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P8">Our duty toward our international neighbors depends very much upon circumstances. In the classic instance on the roa<text:span text:style-name="T4">d </text:span>to Jericho there was never any question of turning over the unfortunate victim who fell among thieves to a Board of Charities and Correction , the cold comforts of a Mandate, or a Supreme Council of any kind ; nor was there any question of including the thieves among the neighbors. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P8"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P8">Our duty toward posterity is very plain . We must keep our lamps trimmed and burning, and refuse to share the oil with our foolish virgins in the vain hope that dawn will be hastened by our generosity</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P8"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P8">For the sake of the low and smoky flame of democracy , which is now all too feeble for the dark hours before us, let us guard the light we have. If we have failed to keep our lamps trimmed ,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">we should be grateful that they are still burning.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">We have failed in our duty to our fellow -citizens chiefly through the partial repudiation of the security held out as an inducement to honest effort in the past, by vicious taxation , fluctuating currency and state-competition , and are now rather peevishly making this situation worse by offering very few guaranteed inducements for the future .</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">In these days of frenzied reform , much of our confusion is due to the things we have done (all in the name of righteous ness ) that we ought not to have done; but our most costly error has been one of omission , having failed to recognize that basic power, which was formerly political, when all power was vested in one head , has now become largely economic. While our fathers dispersed concentrated political power and apportioned it as justly as they could , we have permitted economic power to concentrate until it comes very near domination. Our exasperated efforts to correct the consequences of this have led in some cases to apparent dispersion : in others to the taking over by the state of obvious aggregations of power which it would have been much more advantageous to leave to the citizen ; and finally, in desperation, to state-sanction of these aggregations,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P8">as in California, under the seductive battle-cry that the corporations should pay the taxes. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P8"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P8">There is so much rigid belief in regard to this matter of state - control - ranging from a fervid conviction that only the state should distribute milk , to an ecstatic belief in the wisdom and efficiency of the Shipping Board -- that to question its justification is to scoff at a new gospel.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P8">To clear away these zealous misconceptions, it is necessary to take as nearly as possible a bird&apos;s -eye view of democracy, to see from what it sprang, and to realize again what we originally hoped of it. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P8"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P8">The simplest possible picture of our situation is that we had become, through tribal evolution , political serfs on the estate of one family to which we had conceded all power and all responsibility. This power was exercised individually, or dele gated to favorites by franchises and royal grants, and the responsibility ignored or repudiated , until individual freedom of action became impossible. We withdrew with great difficulty both the power and the responsibility and decided to redistribute sovereignty as fairly as we could among all the residents of the estate. This dramatic change was a natural reaction from an intolerable interference with personal freedom . What we hoped of our altered position was a prevention of similar interference.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">In this way, through the taxing power which we seized, we became the joint-landlords of the estate and were no longer serfs. Surely our collective wisdom should not make us less wise than the individual landlord .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P10">What are the advantageous duties of the landlord, on the simple basis of far-sighted self -interest? Without much controversy they may be catalogued as follows:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P10"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P10">( 1) To maintain order with the least possible interference with the tenant.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">( 2 ) To facilitate production and exchange within the estate</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for the benefit of all the tenants.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P10">( 3) To permit and encourage access to the most advantageous outside markets for the surplus products of the estate.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P10"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P10"><text:soft-page-break/>(4)To scrutinize the character of would -be tenants, to whom is held out the definite promise of ultimately becoming co -owners.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Almost any ordinary landlord would approve this list of duties, while a far-sighted landlord would be keenly interested in seeing that the revenue of each worthy tenant was proportionate to his effective effort, so that there might be given to him every opportunity of improving his individual holdings, the needs and potential virtues of which he knows much better than his landlord. It might be said that some of these alleged obligations go further than far- sighted self-interest ; but it would depend whether the landlord were thinking of himself or the estate. In the case of democracy, on the basis of collective self-interest, we have the logical right to assume that we are dealing with an exceptional landlord, whose chief desire is the success of his tenants.?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Perforce, then , we are the joint-landlords of the estate, with a quick and intimate interest in the happiness and activity of our tenants (who, severally, are ourselves), and it should be fairly easy to agree that our advantageous duties are as stated, namely :</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">To keep order without unnecessary interference ; to facilitate production and exchange ; to permit no avoidable barriers to advantageous markets for our surplus products ; and to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">scrutinize the character of those would -be tenants who ultimately are to become co -owners. Expanding these simple conceptions to the terms of statecraft, we have a definite grouping of duties which should not be hard to appreciate, even though these duties have been the subject of much contention where</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&apos; It is as individual tenants that we are mortally afraid of the single</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">taxers as landlords. They propose to exact the full &quot; rental-value&quot; of land ,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">without any impersonal method of measuring value, or any conception of a scientific unit of measurement. Value of this kind , if stripped to its ugly nakedness, instead of being the orderly relation between known supply and known demand, is the disorderly relation between power and desperation ; and since democracy has of necessity less freedom to make exceptions than our autocratic predecessors, can we look for a contented tenantry when we have bureaucratic control of supply pitted against the individual&apos;s desperate demand, as a basis of rental value ?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P68">they affect the special interests of certain individuals or groups.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P11"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P11">To keep order without unnecessary interference with personal liberty may be said to include the duty of preserving the rights of the person , of preventing monopoly, of arranging just taxation , of sanitation and education , and the duty of terminating unemployment.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The facilitation of production and exchange throws upon the state such proper tasks as drainage, reclamation , reforestation and irrigation, the construction of highways and harbors, the protection of our sea-borne traffic, and most important of all - the guarding against any impairment or repudiation of our tokens of value.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">These two groups comprise our duty to our fellow -citizens in that they ensure, as far as possible, order and consequent freedom of movement.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">To permit no avoidable barriers to advantageous markets and to scrutinize our would -be citizens are also duties to our fellows, and possibly cover our whole duty to our neighbor. It is probable, too, that the fulfillment of all the duties enumerated above will discharge any responsibility we have toward posterity .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">III</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Apart from the safeguarding of the person of the citizen by the state, the first duty is the prevention of any power sufficiently great to challenge or usurp the functions of the state . We have granted to the state the right of coercion only that order may be preserved, but it is a fatal right to yield to any</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">man or group of men within the political boundaries of the country. This our fathers realized and they endeavored to guard the rights of individuals against such a menace as far as possible, though they were more afraid of the state itself developing tyrannous power than they were of any group within</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the state. Despite their precautions, led by optimists and would -be miracle workers, we are now , unfortunately , engaged in throwing down some of the safeguards they erected . If it seemed necessary to be on guard against the possibility of state-coercion, which is ostensibly unselfish , how much more necessary is it to be on guard against coercion by individuals or groups ? Politically this coercion is supposed to be impossible : economically it is accomplished . In spite of the apparent need for caution ,we have permitted the creation of trust-funds with organic vitality so great that it saps that of the community ; and have continued to acquiesce in a system of inheritance which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">suffers the succession of incompetents to great power without corresponding responsibility, chiefly because we have made no intelligent attempt to measure either the one or the other. Our tolerance of arrogant combinations of both capital and labor, and our tendency to permit combinations of a few favored farmers,-- all of these are obvious departures from the original dream of equality of opportunity. We treat the symptoms of malpractice with counter -irritants. The growing danger of this course of action is that we are again permitting economic power to reconcentrate to the advantage of small groups and , in many cases, to the detriment of our freedom . When we become painfully aware of these concentrations, in our lassitude or bad temper, we ill-advisedly hand them over en bloc to various uncoordinated state bureaus which have both the inclination and opportunity to become self-perpetuating, thus limiting individual freedom of action even more rigidly than if the powers had been left in private hands. Many complicated remedies are being tried. The graduated inheritance-tax, with all its clumsy machinery of appraisement, is our ill-considered response to the disguised doctrine of divine -right, but, as it is almost impossible to distinguish between genuine and evasive gifts made prior to death , this whole question is one to be carefully weighed . If we make responsibility proportional to <text:soft-page-break/>power, we can probably save ourselves the trouble of interfering either with gift or bequest if these are any inducement to individual effort, since this individual effort is what democracy</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was designed to encourage.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The high rank of &quot;monopoly&quot; is too lightly conceded in some cases and too vindictively bestowed in others. Brilliant developments of services or ideas may appear to be monopolies owing to the magnitude of their reward, but these services and ideas can be duplicated or bettered by effort and, since the inducement to duplicate or to better is very tempting, the community may well be the gainer by keeping hands off. Nothing is gained by community confiscation ; for if the state seizes all</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">coal and sells it at a loss, no intelligent citizen is going to look for oil, or any competitor of coal. It is also worth while considering whether our socialistic compromise, the effective patent granted by state -sanction and state-supervision to public -service corporations, is not exceedingly dangerous. In effect, enterprise, effort and inventiveness threaten the farmed -out state monopoly, and become high-treason .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The only power we need fear is power that may not be duplicated by any effort; and is therefore in a position to impose tribute under the guise of demanding payment for service. If this conception of monopoly is correct, we have only to look for power which has the capacity for demanding tribute without rendering service in return, and which need not fear duplication. Many of the so -called monopolies, against which we rail, are actually created by state- sanction and are simply the modern</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">economic equivalent of the medieval baron who levied toll with the connivance of the king. We are growing conscious of this situation and a little restive under the repercussion of our remedies. As a matter of fact, monopoly is a scent which always urges forward the linked party-hounds of democracy.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Where we have failed , as stated, is in pursuing our modern predatory barons so far, that we have allowed the state to pick up and utilize much of their hastily -abandoned coercive equipment. Competition by the landlord is disastrous for the tenant; and competition by the state is equally disastrous for the citizen , since individual effort can never compete with state-control. The moment competition is eliminated by the state, we are then very likely to find that we have to deal with connivance between the supervising bureau and the supervised industry .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The explanation of our present confusion is that we have suffered private control of basic economic value, without contingent responsibility, until combinations have been formed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sufficiently dominant to challenge or usurp the taxing power of the state or finally to share it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The maintenance of order also forces our attention to the question of just taxation , since the prime need of taxes is to defray the cost of maintaining order. If taxation is regarded as a means of revenue to be used for the creation of idle offices, it is no better justified than it was when required for the king&apos; s</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mistress. If it is to be used for the creation of Bureaus designed to compete with the private citizen, it has no more virtue than it had when levied on the subject to bolster up the interference and tyranny of the king or his favorites. Under democracy we are interested in taxation , not for the fund created,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but solely to meet the cost of maintaining order and providing general underlying improvements designed to facilitate individual enterprise. Taxation in its simplest terms should obviously be a contribution toward the cost of order in proportion to individual control of value. Control without corresponding responsibility is either tyranny or potential tyranny ; and this is exactly what our fathers went to such pains to escape. It is a condition that we should be quick to resent for our own sakes ;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but, as a matter of fact, most of the victims of this maladjustment are unaware of it, while the beneficiaries are conspicuously silent, and probably quite unconscious of anything but what they regard as the adequate reward of their outstanding virtues.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>In the so -called progressive states of our Union , whenever a telephone is used to save time, whenever a bath is taken of necessity, whenever any labor-saving device, such as truck or</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P11">tractor, is employed , every addition to storage to save waste , all these are taxed . It is now seriously proposed to penalize the exchange of all goods by a tax. Is there any limit to our economic stupidity? Our plain interest and duty is to facilitate production and exchange, and we suffer obstruction and penalty. These things are done in the name of democracy by self -styled reformers, aided by those few who think that they profit by economic confusion.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P11">All indirect taxation -- taxes on exchanges, taxes on consumption ( either direct or through corporations), taxes on improvements and on the means of manufacturing or transportation, -- all these are tolls levied on need and activity . Have we stopped to think that it was because of such tolls as these that other governments waxed fat and irresponsible -- and fell ? </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P11"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P11">Our present scheme of taxation is so inequitable and so unwise that it seems almost unnecessary that the diagnosis go any further. If such a plan for revenue were put into effect on the estate we have pictured - a tax on all tools, licenses for blacksmiths, penalties on improvements, punishment for the planting of fruit trees, and irritating tribute on the transfer and consumption of food -- we should very soon have a revolting or disappearing tenantry. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P11"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P11">This inquiry , then , leads back to the significant question ,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which will come up repeatedly in this attempt at diagnosis : where, under democracy, does basic economic power lie and how has it escaped just measurement for purposes of assessing responsibility ? For surely it is power 2 that should be held responsible and not either activity or need .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The tasks of providing sanitation and education have been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">honestly attempted ; but they have been hopelessly impeded by the fact that our system of taxation has no relation to the purposes of democracy, being a deplorable method of raising funds from the producer, taken over without scrutiny from our deposed tyrants.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The prevention of unemployment is one of our conspicuous failures. No vicious or ignorant landlord could have done worse than we. To have an unoccupied body of labor, breeding crime and discontent, and forming in time of its misery a weapon capable of use by an unscrupulous or harassed employer against a more scrupulous or generous employer, and , in time of desperation , becoming a menace to the state , is to deliberately invite trouble and catastrophe. We deal with this situation so childishly , with our prattling of &quot;minimum -wage,&quot; when we have no minimum value for our dollar, and of unemployment insurance, when there is crying need for labor, that the very kings and barons we cast out must smile sardonically if they can see us. What would any sane landlord do, confronted</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Our failure here is a secondary one. The primary failure is our blindness as to the just relationship between power, the control of value, and taxation , the insurance of value. We know there are specific tasks to be accomplished :we know there are periodic seasons of desperate unemployment ;but we cannot take advantage of the situation because we have elected , or are sufficiently stupid , to tax activity and need instead of power. Power is silent and still evades us ; but we can always lay our hands on need, and intercept activity . We have driven arbitrary taxation -- this ancient weapon of autocracy -- as a wedge between the task and the tool-- between public needs and surplus labor. Owing to our primitive interest in nostrums, we have not stopped to realize that the task and the tool can be much more simply dealt with as two complementary phases of the same problem .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P12">The facilitation of production and exchange is so plainly advantageous to both state and citizen that there is no need to a<text:span text:style-name="T5">m</text:span>plify here. Our failure to provide physical facilities is not due to a lack of perception on the part of anyone as to what should be done, but to the difficulty of ascertaining what we can afford to spend, owing to our absurd taxation , which is based on consumption and activity -- on need and effort - in stead of underlying power .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P12"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P12">General improvements such as the construction and main tenance of highways and other facilities , and the reclaiming of thi<text:span text:style-name="T10">s</text:span> unoccupied public domain , so that it may be turned over to private and pro<text:span text:style-name="T5">d</text:span>uctive ownership as quickly as possible -- these are urgent tasks to be paid for by taxation which is proportionate to control, and which can be automatically increased without hardship as fast as underlying power is enhanced and additional responsibility is thereby incurred .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P12"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P13">The duty of guarding against impairment or repudiation of our tokens of value is one which we have not only failed to meet, but have failed largely to recognize as a vital duty for the trustees of democracy , though our failure here has become glaringly apparent in recent times in the debasement of remuneration and the repudiation of an implied security which was the inducement of much honest effort in the past. Professor Irving Fisher has done invaluable service to the community in emphasizing the measure and effect of this failure. Such debasement or partial repudiation has served as a definite check to honest effort at the present crucial time. Not only as a problem in abstract justice, but as a matter of cold policy , remuneration must insure the future use of their surplus effort to the diligent members of the community to induce the fullest exercise of their activity . There is only one inducement of effort and that is unimpairable value, not subject to erratic taxation, and not subject to dominating power. This again brings up the same significant query : where is such power to be found and what is the basis of its effective domination ? </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P13"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P13">In the last analysis our currency should be a clean negotiable token of basic exchangeable value, insured by order, and guaranteed by an actual pledge of such value. We exercise thrift and effort, and in this way create for ourselves the right to demand effort in return ; otherwise, very naturally ,we do not exercise thrift or effort! If a time comes that our just demand, through carelessness or chicanery , is <text:soft-page-break/>repudiated , there is a very proper sense of injustice and a slowing down of the whole flow of effective effort.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It is more clearly evident today than ever it was, that our currency fulfills not one of the qualifications which the economists lay down. It is certainly not a store of value. It leaks ! It is not a stable measure of value ; and because of this it is not a safe basis for deferred payment, nor a convenient medium of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">exchange. The exchange cannot be made quickly enough ! So far is our currency from being a measure of value that we have come to a point where we calmly , and without any sense of shame, commission a Federal Bureau to measure its fluctuations in terms of goods ! If our currency were bullion, it would then be a scarce and durable commodity of small bulk and, without doubt, very convenient from this aspect, but to say today tha<text:span text:style-name="T6">t </text:span>our currency represents bullion is to expose oneself to the suspicion of being either dishonest or ignorant.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">There are many partial remedies proposed to make our tokens of value representative of value. To talk of barter is to go back to the disorderly methods with which we started – goods for goods, and the devil take the hindmost who is left with a surplus. There is no facilitation of exchange in this proposal, for if put in practice goods would wear themselves out as they moved backward and forward in the liquidation of bargains, and in the absence of desirable goods there would be no payment available for surplus effort. We should live from hand to mouth ; and our civilization would revert to the limitations of tribal intercourse .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P13">To propose as a measure of value or a medium of exchange a bulky and vital commodity such as wheat, is to subject our currency to the threat of inflation from every homestead in the United States, to make the normal cost of remitting balances more nearly ten per cent than one per cent, to live in fear of interruption to traffic, to expose our security to locust and weevil, and to become again worshippers of the sun and seasons. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P13"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P13">To put our trust in labor as a measurable basis of value is fully as foolish as putting it in princes : and for labor as a body, it means ultimately working under the spur of the bayonet or the humiliation of a speedometer. There never was a basis of value suggested more capable of sullen or whimsical dilution than this .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P13">To adopt the fluctuating weight of gold advocated by many, with Professor Irving Fisher as their leader, is to put new wine in old bottles. It is an attempt to compromise , but still deals with currency in terms of fluctuating goods and gold, not in terms of measurable value. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P13"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P13">The solution of this problem is not obvious but surely there can be found, within a well-ordered state, some measurable basic factors of internal value, underlying goods and their fluctuations, which are not subject to moth and rust and not subject to disastrous depletion , substitution or projection into space. The key to the problem seems to be that we must uncover the basic measurable factors of total economic value, so that our negotiable tokens may bear some definite relation to the whole. It is not scientific to limit our currency to a varying percentage of an unknown quantity . It is not even sensible.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The obligations already enumerated would comprise , then ,our duties to our fellow -citizens, if we occupied a self-supporting island in space, and might complete the full list of our responsibilities ; but, fortunately for our advancement, we do not occupy an island in space. Now , if we are too cautious to share control of our country with peoples of different training and motives for the sake of internationalism , nevertheless, we should meet these peoples in as neighborly a spirit as possible , for it is to our advantage to trade our surplus commodities for theirs, if, after a careful investigation , we are sure we cannot use the energy that went into that surplus to better advantage at home. We have here at the outset one amazing folly to acknowledge, which is probably a direct consequence of changing politically from allopathy to homeopathy every four years, in the hope of curing our ailments. In deal ing with our neighbor, whether our motives are good or bad, wise or foolish, having erected barriers against his goods with out any very careful inquiry as to the beneficiary, under one</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rÈgime, we have embarked , under a totally antagonistic rÈgime, upon a magnificent career as a merchant and have enacted legislation such as the Webb- Pomerene law , permitting practices</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that we have regarded as immoral at home, to enable us to place our surplus products on sale in foreign countries , where such immorality is assumed to pass unnoticed. How are we going to be paid ? Our customers by now have little gold , and (as triumphant Republicans) we cry a plague on their goods. With their goods barred by tariff, and lacking money, they offer their services as ocean -carriers, but (as triumphant Democrats ) we refuse their services too, and create a vast, cumbersome and incompetent merchant marine, flouting our needy neighbors and crushing, incidentally , our few optimistic citizens who stood ready to fill any vital gap in the stream of water-borne commerce. From any point of view except that of the imperialist, which is quite logical, but which we hotly repudiate , we are in error and must face the consequences ; for we can only sup port our international fallacies with armed flotillas.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">In dealing with our neighbors, we come up invariably against a most fiercely debated choice of policies -- that of protection or free-trade - of economic barriers or their removal. Fundamentally , this is not an economic question but a political one ; and it is in the confusion of terms that special advantage is gained by those who know what they want for themselves. Tariff for the protection of profits may be a politico-economic consideration : it is an economic absurdity as far as the general welfare is concerned . The protection of certain basic standards, however, is a political safeguard which cannot be neglected if we are threatened with the menacing result of politically sup ported aggregations of economic power in foreign countries, or in our own economic dependencies, for that matter, which give us such things as suspiciously cheap foodstuffs. If it is conceded that taxation is economic responsibility and should therefore be proportionate to basic economic power, then tariffs for revenue are not logically justified . They are tolls of the most stupid and obstructive variety . Barriers for the protection of vital standards, however , are quite another matter . If we do our duty and set a high standard of industrial decency, instead of boasting of it only , we are logically forced to defend this standard against those of our unfortunately organized neighbors who operate on the basis of gigantic sweat- shops for the benefit of a few . It is a little difficult to convince the idealist, but perhaps worth the attempt: </text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P14">If, in advance of a uniform conception of humanity in the various states of the Union , there was any moral justification for grappling with the child -labor question by the effective method of prohibition of inter -state shipments of the products of that unfortunate labor -- and it is reasonable to look for the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">support of the idealist when justification is claimed -- there is equal moral justification for forbidding by interdiction the passage into the Union of the products of similar or even more deplorable conditions in States, situated outside our national boundaries, where economic democracy is repudiated . In spite of the powerful sentimental appeal in the phrase &quot; free trade,&quot; it is also reasonable to demand the <text:soft-page-break/>support of the idealists for a wider use of their method of dealing with domestic unpleasantness. They cannot refuse to recognize that the barriers created between righteous and unregenerate states within the Union are only maintained in the end by Federal force ; and in the end also any barriers erected between economically emancipated and economically backward countries can only be maintained by an Army and Navy. It is very sad to realize that such popular remedies as &quot; Free trade&quot; and &quot; Disarmament,&quot; even though specifically labelled by the idealist as unquestionable virtues must be carefully scrutinized for the sake of our experiment in democracy, as long as we are dealing with autocracy or arbitrary power in any form as well as by us. whatever - and, unfortunately, this cautious attitude may, quite properly, be taken toward us <text:span text:style-name="T7">as well as by us.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P14"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P14">Free trade, like internationalism , is a beautiful dream . Protection under certain conditions is a deplorable political necessity . Our failure lies in permitting it to be anything but protection . What it has been , very notably , is cleverly manipulated privilege in the name of protection.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Import duties, if they are designed for revenue, are taxes on consumption , or, more baldly , they are taxes on need . If they are designed for the protection of importunate industries they are often super -taxes on consumption or need .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">There is probably no very pleasant dose for the clearing up of this complication. It must be faced honestly, taking into consideration from a purely economic standpoint the fact that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tariff for revenue is a major example of pernicious taxation and that tariff for the protection of the intrenched beneficiaries of our present system is even more pernicious. Such taxation is a toll taken from the weaker in either case , and has nothing to do with democracy. It is, in fact, a left-over weapon of irresponsible power, and our so -called reformers show remarkable aptitude in its use , at the behest of special and local interests.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The last duty named in our list, the scrutiny of the character and suitability of would -be citizens before admitting them , is another painful necessity which bowls over a number of our standing ideals at the same time. Reverting to the conception of democracy as an estate of which the citizens are joint-landlords, we may be fully justified in saying self -interestedly, &quot;Our fields are ripe unto harvest and the laborers are few : let them come in .&quot; Or magnanimously , &quot;We have broad pastures untilled and hillsides unterraced ; there is room for all your destitute : let them come in .&quot; The barrier to this policy of permitting the free movement of peoples, which is almost as dear to the idealist as the free movement of goods, is not sheer selfishness and wrong-headedness, even though some of the selfish and the wrong -headed do not approve the invitation. The final barrier is not economic but is political, and is actually the long-cherished hope behind the fine-sounding word &quot; democracy&quot; -- the dream of freedom in a zone of self-imposed order. Under a purely idealistic conception , whether our immigrants come as needed laborers or, for the sweet sake of charity, are yearned over in their destitution, they graduate under our present system into joint-trustees, with no adequate training for the task and little in the way of tradition except a belief that the price of liberty can be paid over to a steamship ticket-agent and the bargain sealed . They also , because of their long-standing aches and pains, have a belief in nostrums even more dangerous than our own.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">We have failed in this task , owing to our lack of comprehension as to the first cost of democracy, and the cost of maintenance, and owing also to the deplorable haste with which we have turned our immigrants over to the demagogue and the privilege-monger for their own ulterior uses. The needed laborers and the dubious refugees we have welcomed so warm heartedly are now joint-landlords together with their spoilers, their sympathizers and those of us who have taken no interest</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>in the problem . For this condition of affairs, there is probably no simple remedy : the barrier to the practice of abstract idealism is our one essential ideal, democracy.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P15">V</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P15"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P16">Our duty to our fellow - citizens, then, is fairly plain , even if a little costly in terms of detached and unrelated ideals. It becomes, perhaps, more apparent that our duty to our international neighbors does depend on all the circumstances in the case , and not on any one ideal in this rather complicated world . Wherever there is no political menace to our basic organization it would be reasonable to look forward to free trade with free neighbors. Wherever there is no danger from their traditions or practices, it would be equally reasonable to look forward to the free movement of free neighbors ;but, apart from lofty considerations, these neighbors must, if we are to survive, suffer and enjoy our mixed handicap and safeguard of democracy before we try to exchange anything on equal terms, even ideals. As far as some of them are concerned we do not think or speak in common terms, and , even after they have accepted among themselves the hazard of political equality, we sha<text:span text:style-name="T8">l</text:span>l then have to scrutinize very closely the extent of their economic emancipation . But we should be sure of our own. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P16"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P16">If we are sufficiently educated to deal honestly with our problems-- if our conceptions of equity are not still distorted by the hope of special privilege -- we may, without any reason to look for immediate peace or comfort, have the bracing sensation of facing our difficulties. The problem of democracy is the isolation and measurement of basic economic power , or control of value, owing to the imperative necessity of apportioning the corresponding responsibility. We have been quite justly so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">proud of the fact that we have a right to insist on a trial by a jury of our peers that we have paid no attention to what became of the King and Executioner and just what new weapons they picked up when we made them drop the sceptre and the axe.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Our prime political ailment, then , is a deep -seated and dangerous delusion that freedom is a self -perpetuating heritage, like royalty, instead of being the direct effect of orderly effort ; and the economic reflex is that we conceive value apart from the cost of order ! Because of these flamboyant delusions, we have failed to make any attempt at measurement, and consequently</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have failed to perceive that there are menacing aggregations of power within our borders upon which we impose no pro rata responsibility . We have suffered this economic power to coalesce and carve out its baronies, and to perpetuate itself through competent or incompetent succession , as chance may dictate. Our other ailments are secondary and are annoying symptoms</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which we attempt to alleviate by the use of specifics. It needs in our cumulative discomfort we are likely to hand over all power to state -bureaus, in spite of the fact that they are eminently capable of interfering with our personal liberty . This development is similar to the progress of megalomania, or irrational self-esteem , which , if it does not result in emasculation , may finally with disillusionment culminate in suicide.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P17">The difficulty of dealing with the matter is this : we imagine that we are a free people. Potentially or politically , we are both free and equal. Actually , or economically , we are not, being still subject to the ancient tyranny of power divorced from responsibility.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P17"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P17">In favor of democracy , in spite of our flamboyant idealism , is youth and exceptional vitality, together with the hope of the old lesion of special privilege being healed and its resultant clots absorbed by the whole system . The present condition of democracy is not a fatal one; but the tendency toward emasculation and suicide must be watched , for the history of recent years with our surrender of <text:soft-page-break/>individual rights has some ominous indications. The old political dose taken at intervals of four years can do little harm , but it is quite useless as a cure. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P17"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P17">Politically , we are a democracy in the simple noncontroversial sense that the ultimate power lies in the hands of the people. Practically we are in grave danger of becoming a plutocratic</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P17">oligarchy with marked imperialistic tendencies ; and unless this is realized clearly , instead of being met by incidental regulation, we are drifting rapidly toward bureaucracy, which is simply a petulant change of servitude. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P17"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P17">Our imperialistic tendency has been indicated in discussing our attitude toward foreign trade, and is confirmed by conditions both at home and abroad. At home we have peri odic unemployment, forcing the quest of new controlled markets to make up for the lack of domestic purchasing power - a lack which we have brought upon ourselves by failing to provide a valid unit of measurement to encourage effort and thrift and to facilitate exchange, and also by interfering with individual effort through archaic taxation . Abroad , by the extension of our tariff, for the benefit of special interests, we collect tribute 3 where we fly our flag. Where we withdraw our flag, as in Cuba, or give our economic dependents the right t<text:span text:style-name="T9">o </text:span>fly theirs, as we have in the Philippines, we force, either d<text:span text:style-name="T9">i</text:span>rectly or indirectly , a continuation of this tribute , and we see to it just as definitely as any King of Spain - and even more effectively -- that our economic dependencies have as little traffic as possible with those nations that challenge our commercial supremacy in certain foreign waters. It is no deliberately malevolent policy, but it slowly crystallizes out from the illogical concentrations of economic power which have arisen because of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">our failure to measure. We have discouraged individual human effort and acquiesced in irresponsible individual control. This is unspeakably poor engineering. With our largely artificial need for foreign markets : with our refusal to accept goods from our neighbors : with our declared determination in our shipping policy not to accept services ; and with most of their</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gold already accepted and stored away, what is there left to take ? Only obligations, and these obligations must be ac</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">∑ This is not as simple a matter as it may seem . The &quot; tribute,&quot; in its final incidence, does not fall upon the economic dependency, but upon our domestic producer of foodstuffs. The dependency pays more for our manufactures ; but receives more for its agricultural produce ; and , on balance, is no worse off. But our modern economic serf, the American farmer, who is the victim of our archaic tax -system , receives less for his produce because of additional competition - and pays more for his manufactured goods. He thinks of this in terms of low prices and high costs : it is nothing more or less than vicious taxation .</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">knowledged by annual tribute and be enforced by an adequate Navy, or, in the end, be redeemed by vital concessions. These will be the humble recognition of our temporary Imperial Economic Highness until the ugly thing some of our more ambitious citizens think that we must build has gone the way of all Empires which are held together for a few pages of history by politico -economic coercion . This may be our destiny, but it is a pity to face it with bandaged eyes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">As already suggested, this curiously contradictory tendency in democracy is inevitable as long as we continue to measure value as we do, and put a tax on effort. We submit to the domination of these archaisms; and invite the struggle for adjustment which naturally plays havoc with all our national calculations. Imperialism is not a French trait, a British trait or an American trait. It is embodied in the imperial habit of thwarting domestic demand, and seeking a more ignorant alien demand.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It is not a pretty picture and many of us will not admit it is a true one - that is our danger. We have our gold barons, our gold earls and our gold dukes, all with their international patents of nobility, possibly even our discreet emperor who moves among us in disguise , taking his subtle pleasure in hobnobbing with two or three guileless but hopeful pretenders ; but thanks be to our fathers who handed them over to us, we have them all on a leash - if only we can pick up the loose end.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Our inquiry into the cause of our ailment shows that at various points there is lost the proper relation between power and responsibility -- the two vital complements of the life-blood</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">* This is confirmed by more competent financial authority. &quot; Ordinarily such a change in the balance of our international finances, if effected gradually, would entail the importation of goods in excess of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">our exports . Our transition to the status of a creditor nation was so abrupt, however, and the subsequent state of world trade and industry has been such that, fortunately, we continue to export goods of greater value than our imports . To mitigate further the consequences of the abruptness of this change in our fiscal position and to facilitate the liquidation of the debts owed us by foreign nations, we must accept their securities until we shall have readjusted our economic position so that we may safely accept in goods a greater proportion of the balance due us.&quot; -- The Guaranty Survey, March 27, 1922, The Guaranty Trust Co., N .

   <text:p text:style-name="P66"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of democracy : at these points there were repeated evidences of economic responsibility shorn of power, and still more definite indications of the existence in the system of economic power</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unchecked by responsibility. Where does such power secrete itself? This is the question to be faced ; for it arose in discuss ing monopoly , pernicious taxation , inadequate currency, unemployment and imperialism as symptoms of our derangement. At some point the proper balance between power and responsibility is not maintained , and there follow numerous distortions.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P18">To check actual monopoly , we realized we had to discover economic power, or control of basic value, subject to no threat of duplication , and deal with this. To readjust taxation , we had to ascertain the distribution of economic power that we might assess pro rata responsibility. To validate our currency, we required tangible factors determining total basic value so that we might be able to employ a token, or pledge, which represents some definite part of this total, so as to check debasement. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P18"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P18">There is only one fixed factor within democracy that meets these requirements, namely , acreage , or foothold : this factor, as modified by population , provides our only scientific means of measuring basic economic power, or control of value, in definite terms, over an extended period of time. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P18"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P18">Gold may be dug from the ground by any one who is lucky : labor strives and becomes capital, a wasting factor, or sulks and ceases to be a factor ; genius opens like a flower and is gone; goods perish and our so - called values change. As for the endless flight of hours, we rob their hive of the accumulation of ages for the needs of a day. Only acreage, or the measure of foothold, stands unaltered within the political boundaries ; and as soon as we realize that this is at all times constant, it is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">purely academic exercise to waste much time over unmeasurable factors. Foothold or acreage is not &quot; land -value,&quot; for such value can be increased and diminished - acreage cannot.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The duty we have so far fulfilled , and our only reason for pride, is that we have not measurably impaired the heritage of political freedom which has been entrusted to us ; and, thanks to our belligerent idealism , are not likely to do so . After all, we have pinned our faith to democracy and this is our ample channel for advantageous effort, if we can clear it of old obstructions. We have nothing to fear save our capacity for self -delusion, which is largely due to the inbred degradations of autocracy, and our prompt adulteration of democracy with schemes for individual vantage and power, the seeds of which are brought in with every immigrant who does not realize that democracy rests, not upon some miraculous domination of cause and effect, or some advantageous domination of the effort of others, but upon that most reasonable yet difficult domination of all -- the domination of self ; for no latter -day miracle is going to make the whole any greater than the sum of its parts.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE COMMUNITY</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">In dealing with any problem of direction, the reformer sees his mark , and no matter what winds are blowing and with no regard for inertia , aims point-blank . The net result of his far and true vision , and his haste, is to plow up his neighbor&apos;s peaceful garden in the foreground. Among the most urgent of reforms is a provision that the professional reformer be only allowed to operate under license as any other pilot. His first qualification should be a thorough knowledge of ballistics , so that in plotting our forward path ,we may be certain that he has taken into consideration not only the desirability of his objective and his available driving force, but also the factors of drift, friction, humidity , dispersion, altitude and gravitation, to say nothing of our recently acquired knowledge of air-pockets. To solve a very simple problem in exterior ballistics, the matter of-fact artillery-man employs formulÊ including all these factors ; and if such an array of modifications is involved in calculating the path and destination of a body of known weight and shape, propelled by definite chemical force, and moving through as penetrable a medium as air, are we justified in following with any confidence a ruled line between Earth and Heaven, even though laid down with as unshaking a hand as that of the enthusiastic reformer , notwithstanding our full appreciation of his beatific vision ? </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P19"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P19">In the realms of economics we have also conflicting and modifying factors, particularly if we regard economics as the study of the measurement, development and distribution of human energy. The conflicting factors are possible of coordination, even though some are vertical and some horizontal, to say nothing of being both negative and positive . There must be co -ordination if we are to keep men hopeful, and ensure the steady forward and mounting path of which democracy dreams, -- but the resultant will probably be a curve, not a straight line.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">II</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Let us take first the most characteristic individual factors, which, for the sake of argument, may be termed vertical, and later consider the community factors, which we shall regard as horizontal. As stated before, the logical interest of the individual is the value arising from effort; and the logical concern of the community is the provision of such order as will encourage this effort.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Normal Individual Considerations</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">First. Owing to the instinct of self-preservation, which is our first and last impulsive clutch at individuality , there was developed in man the faculty of foresight, arising from the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">natural desire for that assurance of continuing freedom which we call security. The desire of self-preservation lies at the base of all our motives, even though in its simpler forms it is not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P19">our most picturesque motive. Without its assurance, however , the successive motives do not come logically into play. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P19"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P19">Second. This desire of security, or the continued assurance of freedom , is the prime motive of extra-effort, self-denial, thrift and less worthy striving, and , if permitted by the community, leads to the accretion of capital, or stored effort, to guard against the uncertain future.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Third . In spite of the existence in the system of money, the conventional token of arbitrary value, and its momentary acceptance as a guarantee of freedom , nevertheless, the individual control of land -area <text:soft-page-break/>has consistently been regarded as the only valid assurance of continued individual freedom , even in the face of predatory taxation . This instinctive economic wisdom is the basis of the peasant&apos;s &quot; land-hunger&quot; and has been bred in his bone.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">These three primary considerations show as briefly as possible the reason for contending that normal individuals, as they have succeeded in dispersing sovereignties inimical to their freedom , and have endeavored to command security through accretion of value, have instinctively converted their accretions into land -ownership or control of territory. Economic cycles, the commencements of which were contemplated by long-buried ancestors, have driven the lesson home . Communicating the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P20">sequence by tradition , a family or community , through many generations, has jointly seen the unit of economic power expressed in terms of force, superstition or convention , and from each of these practices has slowly withdrawn approval. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P20"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P20">With the guidance of the historian we can see more sharply that, no matter how modified by the restraints of the community or by environment, the conventional &quot; unit&quot; of economic value has changed from the club, as wielded by the primitive savage, to the man -at-arms, as utilized by the brigand and baron : from the superstition manipulated by the magic-man , to the domination of the church ; and finally from the money, issued by the king and his concessionaires in the days of arbitrary political power, to the conventional tokens of vague value adopted by democracy ; and realizing these changes we can appreciate the fact that the final repository of value is land area. The reason for this is that land is limited in quantity; and is not subject to unexpected and distressing duplication , such as, by a stouter arm , upset the calculations of the primitive man with his club : by surprise and ambush played havoc with the man -at-arms: by successful schism destroyed the domination of the priest ; and by dilution or debasement of the value of money sapped the power of those who put their trust in it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The same review of economic history also indicates why the resentment against unrestricted taxation of land has been so deeply rooted. Here is the lËse majestÈ of democracy, though we feel this rather than perceive it. In effect, it is a proposal to permit the community to debase, for any whim or desire, our hard-earned individual security . Without clearly defined and adequate guarantees, it is as easy to persuade land-holders, large or small, joint or several, to acquiesce in the sole taxation of land, on the basis of personally-appraised value, in the name of reform , as it is to persuade a solvent merchant to go joint account with a potential bankrupt, for the sake of activity . It may conceivably be done, in the name of democracy, by a forward -looking reformer ; but if no definite limitations are agreed upon and if no proper allowance is made for the upward striving individual, the reformer&apos;s forward motion , ignoring trajectory, is likely to be of short duration.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">III</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P20">Normal Community Considerations </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P20"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P20">There are also certain primary community considerations which , again without reproach , are of vital importance to all of us jointly ; and it should not be difficult to realize that they are logically divergent from these equally proper individual considerations already enumerated .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Just as the desire for ample personal security sometimes develops, by sheer momentum , the opportunity of coercive power , and the exercise of this power has the effect of a taste of blood upon a predatory animal, so the exercise of delegated control may overreach itself and develop into an equally</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">blind lust for bureaucratic coercion in the name of &quot; progress.&quot; In the hands of such self -seeking leaders as democracy is bound to develop while it awaits experience and is still a ferment, the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>thirst of the demagogue and his henchmen for personal power vitiates all the simple calculations of the idealist. Under our present economic system -- a logical evolution in which the growth has been from the tap-root of self -interest and the pruning from the hastily erected scaffolding of community-interest-- there has been a steady curtailment of individual power as this has overshadowed and thus threatened the security of the community . Owing to the necessity of haste and to lack of experience , these limitations have occasionally had unexpected results ; but by this process of pruning, the private maintenance of armed forces and the economic domination of the church have passed into the hands of the community ; and more lately , the expansion and contraction of currency and bank -notes, and the validation of credit for the purpose of increasing the volume of money, which is a very dangerous power in the hands of individuals and groups , has also passed partially to the community under our Federal Reserve System , with consequences which still demand open -minded scrutiny, since what we have done is to delegate these arbitrary powers of validation to a narrow personal control, however</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">carefully selected. This, under our political system , is almost bound to suffer periods of deterioration with disastrous results, for the very impersonal reason that our present currency has no integral relation to basic value.1</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The arbitrary units of power , therefore , as they became un duly massed in individual hands, have been either dispersed or absorbed by the community ; but the silent concentration of power in land-ownership has not yet been dealt with as a<text:span text:style-name="T12">n </text:span>immediate menace. This is due to the absence of direct pressure, owing to the intervention of an arbitrary system of taxation and a spurious basis of value, both of which break the enlightening sequence of cause and effect. With growing economic consciousness, however, the domination of large land holdings is beginning to be brought to focus locally in this</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">country and to be apprehended even more keenly elsewhere.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Certain popular legislation in Great Britain and Australia, the economic justification for which may well be questioned, has been in response to noticeable pressure and gathering apprehension . In the United States, the imposition of an inheritance tax is perhaps our first hasty defensive posture but, even with this</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">- a desperate attempt to create economic demand out of thin air was probably one of the incurable conditions that forced Germany to try to cut her way out of an impossible situation by the sword. It was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fairly well known to merchants doing business in South America and the Orient, that the long-term credits granted by the officially supported merchant-emissary of the German Government were not sound ; but they were validated by a long chain of banks centering in Berlin whose functions were semi-official. The rosy-looking but ridiculous expansion went on while our zealous American Consuls upbraided us for failing to follow suit : we could not, then ; but we are opening the way by various devices for making endorsed foreign obligations a further basis of currency.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P66">haphazard and ill-considered precaution, the irresponsible control of land-area is not necessarily broken, so that there are as yet no very happy or logical results to be recorded of a new</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21">effort to disperse menacing aggregations of individual power which exist through direct or indirect control of area . If the proceeds of such taxation are employed mainly to fatten the stirring political leeches and initiate destructive competition by the state with the less powerful individual, there is nothing gained . All that can be expected of this very unscientific method of pruning is that it will compel a partial and costly re distribution of basic economic control into other irresponsible hands; for unless we see that economic responsibility is also redistributed at the same time, we have not accomplished much except to convert massed friction into scattered friction. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21">In this discussion the community is not regarded as an aggregation of individuals enjoying in common the benefits of all individual effort, but as a trustee through which necessary authority is brought to focus to guarantee order. The community - sentimentalists to the contrary notwithstanding while it has obvious interests, has no inalienable rights. A community may be an aggregation of hobos whose joint and several ideal of happiness is the appropriation of pies from back porches. The method of approach and the division of the spoils may be jointly settled upon in advance, but no kind providence guarantees the pie ; and this applies also to more respectable communities.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The following are put forward, then , as normal community</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21">motives : </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P21">First. The major interest of the community is continuity of order or the maintenance of conditions which will ensure a maximum flow of effective effort.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Second. A maximum flow of effective effort in a self governing community can only be obtained by utilizing the pressure of necessity and the inducement of unimpairable reward.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Third. In utilizing the guarantee of reward to encourage individua<text:span text:style-name="T13">l</text:span> initiative to make its maximum effort, the community must deliberately sanction specific and irrevocable inducements. It cannot retain all the cake -- as the socialists demand openly and the single-taxers unwittingly contrive -- and still hold out part of the same cake as an inducement.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Fourth . If, as shown in discussing individual motives, the control of land with immunity from molestation is the only logical key to individual security , and therefore the most effective inducement of effort, the community is fully justified , first, in permitting the private ownership of land and, second, in making this ownership the guaranty of all intermediate inducements.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">IV</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It may seem a little arbitrary to assert that land -ownership is the only adequate guaranty of inducement; but this conclusion can hardly be escaped . The essential factors of value, as will be shown more fully later , are land-area , population and time; and with two of these, time and population , not subject to control, the third factor, that of area or foothold , then becomes the definite key to freedom , or value, whichever we care to call it. Henry George partially perceived this ; but it is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">important to realize what both Henry George and his followers overlook , -- If land-ownership is the ultimate key to value, it is also the only valid key to our individual accumulations of value through extra-effort and utilized time. Conceding freely the justification of his emphasis upon the power conferred by land ownership , this is the very reason in the end why we will not part with this key to popularly elected wardens. If there is a proper charge for our storehouse , let it be on the basis of <text:soft-page-break/>capacity, not of contents ; exactly as in the case of any other safe -deposit. If the community is going to encourage individual deposits, it must hand over the key to the depositor.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22">V</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P22"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Recognizing that individual interests and community interests are quite logically divergent, the former being concerned with effort and the latter with order, it should be apparent</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">that a proper co -ordination of these interests will give , as a net resultant, a maximum measure of individual freedom , or, in other words, a maximum flow of value. To the zealot, <text:s/>( or to the reformer who feels that his personal fortunes are best served by acting as a special-agent for the state ), compromise between state interests and the interests of the individual may be abhorrent. It is compromise, however, that determines the unfaltering motion of the earth -- the basis of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">all dynamic science. With growing experience, the community may come to realize that economic value arises from the just balancing of effort and order. It has failed to recognize this, owing to the fact that sovereign responsibility for the cost of order has been dispersed together with sovereign</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">power, but has not been justly apportioned. It is passed on steadily down the line, until it reaches the most helpless and most involved . </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">The economic problem , then, which as stated earlier, is to develop , measure and distribute human energy, resolves itself primarily into the preservation of the community as a trustee of order , purely for the sake of the free movement of the individual. The community can only be preserved by the adequate production of current wealth , so that the initial and final task is the devising of ways and means for ensuring production , without destroying the personal freedom which has been our lode- star through all the struggle. The integrity of the functioning-power of the unit is at the bottom of all energy, and , lacking energy, control becomes an empty office.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">As stated by Gilbert, who had sufficient sense of proportion to make a sound economist, the first step is &quot; to make the punishment fit the crime,&quot; or, conversely , to make the recompense fit the work ; and the striking of a just balance here will tend gradually to eliminate the hobos of our upper, middle and lower classes. How, without infinite supervision, can this be done by the state?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">It cannot be done by sudden attempts at drastic leveling which disregard all joint-undertakings entered into with those who worked in the past. This , for democracy particularly, would be a fatal betrayal of trust and there would result a lowering of morale, which would have an evil effect for years to come. Annoying as the idea may be to the reformer, inequity, like rain , falls alike on the just and the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">unjust. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">If land -area is held in few hands without adequate responsibility, the balance of the community faces the prospect of giving labor on the basis of sheer need , which is not a very happy outlook . Asmay be observed in such crowded centres as Pittsburgh or New York , this basis results in a maximum production of material wealth with a minimum of individual happiness. On the other hand , if land passes entirely to the state, the only compulsion left for unwilling labor is force of arms, which is the end of freedom and will divide society into two camps : official coercers and officially coerced, since inertia will be one of the most important modifying factors to be reckoned with when need and reward have both been eliminated by the reformer.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">Avoiding these alternate dangers of permitting land- area to be controlled by a few , or consenting that it be held jointly by the community , if the foregoing argument is sound , the middle are not averse to work by automatic reward, the value of which cannot be impaired (&quot; If the salt have lost its savor, <text:soft-page-break/>wherewith shall it be salted&quot; ) , and the maximum production of those who are averse to work by the logical pressure of necessity. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">This is roughly the present condition of our tortuously moving stream of human energy, with all the dead water due to legislative debris and the friction arising from bad economic engineering. Our superficial palliatives designed to temper need and our genius for impairing reward, exemplified by our extravagant relief work on one hand, and our taxation and currency on the other , tend to cut down this flow . At every point we permit friction or introduce it, and the stagnant pools , even though they may take the fading colors of sunset, are breeding places of despair. Within these areas lie two of the most dangerous groups in democracy :</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">(a ) Those who are reluctant to exercise effort, but, owing to our bad management, receive remuneration and avoid responsibility .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">(<text:span text:style-name="T14">b</text:span> ) Those who are eager to exercise effort, but fail at critical times to find an opportunity , owing to the same bad management which permits the former group to avoid responsibility. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P23">It is in these backwaters that the silt tends to gather, impeding still further the flow of energy , but they can surely be dealt with by the community without adding again to the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">disastrous stagnation .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">VI</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">As already stated, the definite function of land-ownership is not obvious, being obscured by our conception of land-value, since this value is vitiated by incalculable taxation and by its subsequent expression in terms of the dollar, a unit based , not upon measurable value, but upon a single commodity – gold -- which is still the effective lever of men without a country. It should be emphasized again that the profitable domination of value through land-ownership , while fully apparent in our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24">cities, is not apparent in the country, owing to our erratic taxation, mentioned above . </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P24">The surplus products of labor lodge ultimately upon land and inure to the benefit of the holder by attracting population . This land, therefore , must be made the basis of all tokens of value and should , directly or indirectly, be the chief inducement and irrevocable reward of extra- effort, provided it carries with it the responsibility of power. This hope of reward , together with the guaranty of its validity, are the greatest factors of stability devisable. Our present economic discomforts are due to a partial application of this principle vitiated by whimsical taxation and the lack of any scientific means of measurement. We have abandoned economic power to the individual without attempting to measure the corresponding responsibility , and have granted the full right of bequest of this unbalanced power, a custom which has nothing to do with democracy. There is good reason to believe that bequest was originally concerned with the passing on of responsibility , and, in the days of the patriarchs, power was bequeathed to support this responsibility .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">* See page 239.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P66">The inheritance -tax is our first effort at empiric adjustment; but, as already indicated, there is the gravest danger of this being utilized largely for state aggrandizement, which will tend to make the logical and necessary rewards still more remote for our children . In permitting land-ownership we have done a good thing in that we encourage effort, but in divorcing this power from absolutely contingent responsibility in proportion to the population and the area , we have very much overdone a good thing, and to the confusion of all hopeful and normal individual planning we are today face to face with the condition that to those who have largely is given and from those who have less is taken away that which they have. Here is the seed of revolt.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">AN ATTEMPT TO CALIBRATE ECONOMIC FACTORS</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">THERE has, perhaps, in the United States, been so much</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">demand for the services of the engineer in the immediate task of making available for human habitation our great areas of land , that he has left the field of Economics largely to those who have not been trained in the art of measurement. If he now venture into this field , it is with a consciousness that certain professional economists, whether of the ecclesiastic or evangelic type, may be inclined to resent what they are likely to regard as an intrusion ; and if some acerbity creep into the normally downright and impersonal diction of the engineer, it should not be regarded as a pretension to any special qualifications justifying his participation in politico-economic controversy, but rather as a belligerent reaction arising from his natural trepidation . Nevertheless, since so -called economists claim for their <text:soft-page-break/>dicta the full rank of scientific truth they must permit these dicta to be examined with instruments of greater precision than a crystal, with its generally admitted possibility of varying interpretations. Such an examination cannot do any harm .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The engineer, no less than the economist, has faults peculiar to his profession . He is likely to be quite uncompromising when it comes to the necessity of brushing out a rose -garden for the sake of a clear sight, and is inclined to grow a little peevish over the drifting of Polaris ; but he must always work out his last crucial course and close his survey. The engineer will be the first to acknowledge that much work has been done in the way of courageous classification of multitudinous data, and the first to look for some tangible product which may be worth examination after the crucibles of controversy have cooled off. He has, of course, the definite advantage of entering the field of economic enquiry after a great deal of the labor of the day is over.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">As a matter of fact, the engineer who ventures in the economic field is much in the position of a transit-man who fol lows the long and patiently -sought route to the far-seen mountain gateway of a projected transcontinental road : he can check levels and estimates by triangulation from many hard-won</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">clearings. With gratitude and admiration he traces the foot steps of a straggling line of pioneers : and since these were truly pioneers, pursuing varying paths, there are pathetic divergences to record as well as some very happy intersections. A few of these pioneers, because they did not tread identically the same path as the men who went before them , had to break new trails ; and for their toil and perplexity they claimed the reward of originators, treating their fellow -investigators with contumely . </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P25"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P25">From the standpoint of the engineer, the political-economists differ so widely when they disagree, they surely can not all be right, and there should be no hesitation in saying so ; for we have to deal with economic explorers of the type of both Cook the Captain and Cook the Doctor; but even for those whose bones lie bleaching far off the logical levels, the engineer can only have the deepest respect and should acknowl edge frankly the clearings which have made his task so feasible .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P25">There is one point which cannot be over- emphasized : a survey by triangulation will show logical termini and some obvious intermediate stations, so that the plotting of the long up-hill gradient on paper is a comparatively simple undertaking which may well result in a persuasive small-scale chart ; but some of the facile projections, however logical, may lightly bridge heart-breaking problems of excavation, fill and drain age; and there is no one more ready than the engineer to acknowledge the cost and difficulty of this kind of work . </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P25"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P25">In going back over the contributions made to economics it seems evident that there has been in some instances a sense of unexplored territory sufficiently great to account for much</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mental wandering. But there are notable exceptions. Many of the writers, instead of merely binding the available data <text:span text:style-name="T15">in separate sheaves and leaving it ingeniously piled in the rick, </text:span>have shown a definite sense of the necessity of completing the operation of threshing and winnowing and thus ascertaining what was obtainable as a vital and final harvest, however meager.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Some of the more philosophic contributors to economic re search, such as Adam Smith , Herbert Spencer and John Stuart Mill, have made invaluable contributions in the way of wider correlation ; but to the engineer, with his trained predilection for unbroken logic, the earliest writer to make a strong appeal is probably Jean-Baptiste Say who, though he wrote over a century ago , is more consistent than many a modern writer. In the work of this man there is always the sense of a compact structure properly tied together. As a brief example, he avoids obvious confusion as to money by classing it, not as a unit of value, but as a commodity. This , under our present system , is logical even if not very satisfactory. It <text:soft-page-break/>is easy to assert lightly , as some of his critics do, that Say is not original; but this after all is one of his credentials. There is more need of pruning in economics than there is of hybridization . Say cut back bravely till the trunk and branches were discernible .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>

   <text:p text:style-name="P66">unsatisfactory aspect of this so-called science is the lack of basic coordination, the subsequent lack of correlation of its formulÊ , and the resulting absence of sustained argument, free of apology or specious modification . Many of the argumentative flights seem to be but skil<text:span text:style-name="T16">l</text:span>ful circling. From the economic ark of Land-value, Labor and Capital -- an ark which is anchored to nothing finite or measurable -- the dove is sent out seeking for dry land and, finding no place to set foot, returns to its floating premises.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Most economists admit that economics is primarily a study of values. As Gide puts it, &quot; The notion of value is really the basis of all political economy . . . in fine, works on pure political economy are in reality nothing but treatises on value.&quot; 4 And further, &quot; Value . . . therefore necessarily pre-supposes a comparison between . . . two things. It is a notion of the same class as size or weight . . . to obtain a clear idea of size, weight, value and all other quantitative notions . . . we must compare all things with one specific object which shall always be the same: we need one single term of comparison : in a word , we require a common measure.&quot; 5 Here ,with a very precise statement of simple value, is a basic error, for economic value, the exertion of human effort, in the medium of matter, is not of the same class as size or weight. It is a dynamic value of the same class as energy.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Economics as it stands today, therefore, is a quantitative science without a unit of value ! In physics we have the foot-pound-second: in electricity we have the kilowatt-hour : and these, even if not absolute, do define energy in terms of the only constants we know , and give us some point at which to commence and some point at which to stop and tally. Few economic arguments have either beginning or end , and it is no wonder that they become tedious. Our scientific unit of weight is not absolute , but it is constant in its relationship to the mass of the earth. The kilogram , upon which various</text:p>

It will be seen then , that even our physical units are not absolute but relative. The kilogram , the weight upon which so much depends, where precision is concerned , is actually affected by the impingement upon the solar system of some far inter stellar disturbance, by the contraction of the sun and planets themselves and by the slowly diminishing velocity of that great battery of dynamos in whose balanced and co-ordinated field , we exist. These influences, however , do not affect the relative integrity of our physical units. But in economics we lack any scientific basis of value whatever . We hamper ourselves with a so -called unit of value, the Dollar, which bears no relationship to the fundamental limits which establish the equilibrium of our economic field . As a consequence, when the fluctuating values we desire to measure are determined in terms of our so - called unit, we find that our unit has fluctuated in a different degree and for entirely different reasons. We are foolishly endeavoring to measure one unknown in terms of another unknown -- an old and hopeless problem .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The engineer, however, is quick to acknowledge that an enormous amount of invaluable work has been done by the economists under extraordinary difficulties, and the engineer of all men , is most ready to admit that anything in the way of a short- cut should be carefully scrutinized. As a matter of fact, he only presumes to challenge certain dicta on the ground that they are not correlated ; for he knows that if economics is a science, then all its phenomena are integrally joined . Nevertheless, he enters the holy places very modestly , being aware that he has had no instruction as to whether he should take off his</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P27">revenue : to investigate the flaws in currency was to question and there is justification for saying that, even today, a straight forward query as to such vital facts as an engineer would know for his guidance will set an old - fashioned economic ritualist shaking his head over the dangers of heresy. It is only necessary , for example , to ask what scientific sanction there is for measuring human effort, and freedom , its logical resultant, by means of ounces of gold of a fluctuating replacement- cost in terms of that same initial effort. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P27"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P27">Let us get outside the noble economic edifice for a moment, with its wonderfully blended medley of architecture, its dim lights, its interesting historical associations, its rose windows and its lack of plumbing ; and sit in the sunshine on some con venient tombstone in the churchyard to talk the matter out.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The most deplorable lack is a point of departure which will &quot; stay out&quot; : we have no datum in the form of a measure of such values as we must discuss. Our physical unit ofweight is the relation between the fractional mass of the material of which it is formed and the total mass of the earth ; and our just economic measure must also have this relative integrity , maintaining a constant value in the total pressure of the economic field . Freedom - the power to move -- this is the only thing that truly constitutes economic value; for economic value in the last analysis is clearly our ability to maintain our freedom of motion in a field of inevitably modifying pressure. What, then, are the logical factors, not subject to hazard or manipulation , by which the total pressure of the economic field may be measured ?</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P27">It should be emphasized that this qualification of scientific factors of value is vital: they must be factors which are not subject to hazard or manipulation . Now let us see what the political- economists have put forward as so -called basic factors of value to support their theories, and see how they were arrived at. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P27"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P27">When the systematic study of economic data was commenced the whole weight of circumstances tended to make it a study of consequences rather than causes, since the arbitrary political factors were so inescapable , and so over-weighed the fundamental and scientific factors, that the nearest approach to approximation of the most important factor of all, at that time, was the king&apos;s obituary. This appraisement was not only post mortem , making scrutiny rather charitable, but was also subject to censure if exactness were too closely reached. We must remember that the unfortunate investigators of that day had alleged &quot;majesty,&quot; &quot; power,&quot; &quot; grace&quot; and &quot; virtue&quot; ( supported by adequate armed forces) all as barriers between economic factors and political factors, so that the latter -- the political factors - were all that it was safe to use if the political-economist desired to pursue his researches in the bosom of his family . Now to the engineer, the autocrat who meddles with fundamental factors is no better than a drowned rat in a drain pipe, as far as the measurement of flow is concerned. To avoid any unfairness it is only reasonable to add that democracy has many obstructions in its system today in the form of bureaucrats ; but individually these are easier to dislodge. Our chief dis advantage is their number, which tends constantly to increase . </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P27"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P27"><text:soft-page-break/>What was there to measure in those days? As a basic eco nomic factor Land-area was hardly worth measuring, so few were the freeholds and so close was the possibility of acquiring new territory by appropriation and conquest : Land -value could be no better measured then than now -- there was nothing to measure it with that would stay still. Commerce worked deviously under royal charters, with the king&apos;s mistress as a silent partner : Labor, even in its so -called golden era , operated</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">through closely -guarded guilds that made, gratis, a few shoes or nose- clouts for the king, and made economic fools of every one else ; Capital was reinforced by autocratic franchise and was brazen, or it was unprotected and secretive. It was at this point that the political-economist started in to assemble his &quot; scientific &quot; data , with a courage and optimism that almost moves one to tears. Every factor was vitiated by an unknown arbitrary component.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Suddenly , at isolated points, the smoldering fires of revolt blazed out and swept away the underbrush - a purging fire doing much immediate material damage but letting in the sun light on dangerous bogs and loathsome thickets. A great deal of so -called majesty , grace and royal highness was swept away ; and it might have been possible at that time to get down to fundamentals and do some sound measuring ; but all was not lost to the old order ; the ritualists came back with all their formulÊ intact , and built up again the sequence of their creed. That few save unfortunate and unwilling school children or</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">older neophytes have ever attended their carefully intoned services has never bothered this type of ritualist : it was enough to definitely impress a few superstitions on the young mind to act as an automatic check to clear thinking in any later emergency, and thus maintain their position .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">As a matter of fact, it would appear that the valid and measurable factors were either ignored or obscured ; but, from time to time, some zealous nonconformist has gained a following, by realizing and emphasizing the importance of a single factor. These contributions were occasionally vital, but</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P27">more often were colored by a notion of advantage to a particular class , or by some vain desire for a miraculous amelioration of the lot of all humanity. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P27"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P27">In this way the Physiocrats emphasized one phase of land - namely its productive power. Herbert Spencer and John Stuart Mill emphasized the vital importance of all land to organized society, and questioned the validity of individual title. Henry George saw its power of domination , though he added to the primary economic significance of land-area many enrichments which defy calculation , and normally are resultants of labor.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Labor , emphasized first by Adam Smith , and glorified out of all proportion by Karl Marx, was in its turn regarded as the only clue to sound economic reasoning. In due course other</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P27">incalculable phases of effort such as invention , risk , organization and uncertainty -bearing, had their excited discoverers, </text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P27"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P27">The list of &quot; economic factors&quot; put forward is much more lengthy than this and it would be entertaining to examine in detail ; but in spite of the tendency to respectfully modify the conventional trinity of Land -value, Labor and Capital, many of these schisms do not make for clarity, nor do they command anything but scattered attention from the more orthodox economists. To the engineer very few of them seem to comprehend the essential importance of exactness or what for emphasis might be called &quot;measurability&quot; as a qualification for a valid factor. To paraphrase the elementary logic of the nursery rhyme</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Some of these departures from ritual, however , are exceptionally interesting and have the same significance as the first protests against the rudimentary and semi-mystic conceptions of chemical reactions.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Ely starts very cautiously by stating, &quot; It has been customary to speak of three factors of production - Nature, Labor and Capital.&quot; He does not protest strongly against this ill assorted group of factors which include infinity in the guise of Nature, except to point out soundly that &quot; Capital cannot be looked on as an independent factor of production since <text:span text:style-name="T17">it </text:span>is derived from the labor of man applied to nature.&quot; From</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this point on he examines with great care and with great lucidity a long series of consequences which arise from the interactions of labor and capital within the infinite theater of nature. When he arrives at the examination of interest he comes within a hair &apos;s breadth of putting forward the simple factors of dynamic human energy, stating, &quot; so the ultimate factors in production may be said to be land, labor and waiting .&quot; ? </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P27"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P27">How can waiting be measured except by time? It is as though he stated the truth under an opiate without perception of its dynamic significance; for it goes without saying that if waiting were a factor of production, most of us would be very rich. It is not waiting he means; for such waiting is simply</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P27">the apparent loss of time involved in the maneuver of calling forward the reinforcement of capital with a view to subsequent haste or saving of time. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P27"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P27">The pressure of population upon area enhances the importance of time as a factor in a closely organized community ; and it is in the examination of the phenomenon of <text:span text:style-name="T18">interest</text:span> that the economists come closest to comprehending the vital significance of <text:span text:style-name="T18">time</text:span>.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The consideration of interest forces us to recognize the factor of time, and it is in the investigation of interest -- the effort bid per hour for the jeopardized freedom of others that we shall later come across a group of dazed but courageous economists holding the factor of <text:span text:style-name="T18">time</text:span> at arm &apos;s length as</text:p>

Here we are again left groping at the very outset ; for while Labor under certain conditions may be approximated by population, how can we measure Nature? We are given infinite Nature and one of its phases as factors, but the product of these two can only be infinity, which leaves us, not dealing with a science, but wrestling with metaphysics. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">Marx , as already pointed out, employs one factor only , namely Labor ; but this is propaganda, not science , and is as though we were to attempt to measure heat by heat, or electricity by electricity. He leaves us with the problem of calculating a dynamic value of one dimension - apparently simple , but utterly hopeless. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">Marshall 8 adds to Land , Labor and Capital, the factor of Organization , but this, as he utilizes it, is simply a division of labor into two indefinite complementary parts, one physical and the other mental, which only adds to the confusion .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Jevons, in spite of his prophetic encouragement to the engineer and his intelligent interest in time, starts his &quot; Theory of Political Economy&quot; with the statement that Utility , Wealth , Value, Commodity , Labor, Land and Capital &apos; are the elements of Economics. Time is not mentioned in this so-called elementary list, so that, however lavish , it is not as comprehensive as it appears. To get an idea of its appeal to a scientist let us approach him with a statement that the elements of electricity , by which we are to determine the advantageous control, measurement, de velopment and distribution of electric energy, are as follows :</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">UTILITY ( The facilities provided by curling tongs, electric toasters, arc-lights , street cars, etc.) :</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P28">WEALTH ( The realizable value, in terms of a fluctuating unit of value, of all power , all power-plants and the product of all power- plants) :</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">COMMODITY ( The products due to the utilization of electric power which are available for exchange ) :</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">LABOR ( The number of fluctuating units of value shown on the consolidated pay-rolls of all companies, with some question as to whether the engineers and managers should</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P29"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P29">LAND ( Let us say the total conducting medium employed for controlling, concentrating and redistributing the power, with much emphasis on its composition ) ; and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">CAPITAL ( The number and price, in terms of a fluctuating unit of value, of all new and second -hand generators, transformers and motors, as well as almost everything else already included in Wealth and Commodity, even if we ignore the quarrel between those who would include Land, and those who won&apos;t) .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">This generous list of so -called elemental factors is enough to keep the electrician calculating aimlessly for the rest of his life. Yet they are as parallel as may be to the medley of factors that preoccupy the economist. He may insist upon using them with devout and tremulous hands -- but he must</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P29">not insist upon our interest in his findings. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P29"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P29">The electrician would brush all these away and would call</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for his well-calibrated instruments of precision which are nothing more than elaborations of the foot-rule, the balance and the chronometer. He would request the economist to take away his inventory and guess again at available energy by making some toast for the next meal on the electric toaster,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and calling it capital, his prime factor.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">At this juncture it is advisable to give the reader rest by changing the picture. In trying, with the best intentions in the world , to extricate an economist politely , the rescuer sooner or later goes down for the third time into the weedy depths with the struggling object of his pity and is lost. The results are a</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">10 This characterization of value would not be fair if Jevons himself</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P66">surge of mud-clouds impinging on the matted surface of the stagnant pool, a few bubbles, and a faint ripple that reaches the bibliographic shores. The public loses sight of the two struggling victims till some poaching economic heretic with his dynamite gets past the academic gamekeepers and brings up the two melancholy corpses locked together in their death grip . It may appear very rude to choke the unfortunate economist you are trying to bring ashore ; but the gentle methods of the academicians in dealing with each other have not been effective ; and it is all rather uninteresting to the spectator, who would have liked to see one or the other of them</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reach firm ground .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">In unwritten faculty records there is a legend of a brilliant mathematician whose constant war-cry was &quot; You must not measure power with potatoes !&quot; And in worthy exasperation he has been seen to hurl a full two-pound box of blackboard chalk at an embryo political-economist who tried it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Here is the danger : we can approximate the effective energy of any system by its product, provided we know accurately all the factors of friction and leakage. By this method we could measure the horse -power of a tractor in terms of a commodity unit made up of the number of pounds of baked potatoes remaining unconsumed by a farm -crew - if everything else were constant -- but we would not expect anyone but a political economist to tackle the problem by this method. The proper procedure is to measure the normal resistance, the density and velocity of our expanding gases in grams and seconds, and the area of our cylinder in cubic centimeters, -- and then start an enquiry into the reasons for the shortage of baked potatoes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The answer may be in terms of friction, faulty ignition, lack of lubrication, potato -bugs, eelworms, drought, sabotage, or a thieving or wasteful cook ; but all this is simply an analysis of lost effort. Above all else in economics it is the tragic delay in devising a unit of value and in subsequently tracing lost</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P29">effort that brings it under impeachment by the engineer. If economics is a science, let us get down to fundamentals as in any other science whose object is knowledge and measurement. If we are going to employ factors, let us at least employ factors of measurement which themselves are measurable. If this is too much to ask , then economics is not a science it is a dubious ritualistic art with the scope and the patter of astrology.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P29"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P29">Gide in the impetus of his logic, actually went through and beyond his goal; in the first edition of his work on Political</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Economy he employs one fundamental factor, Labor, and five basic contributing agencies, namely :</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Raw -Material</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P29">Ground (or superficial area ) </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P29">Time</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Tools (or capital)</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Environment</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P29">With creditable reluctance he then groups these under the three classic heads of Land (or Nature) , Labor and Capital.11 </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P29"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P29">By applying the test of &quot; exactness&quot; it becomes obvious that only three of these are valid factors, and it is much more than a coincidence that these three- Labor (defining density ) , Ground (defining volume) and Time 12 (defining duration of effort) , are the ultimate limits of any phase of energy and the essential factors of dynamics. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P29"><text:soft-page-break/>Let us examine Gide&apos;s factors, one by one, and see where they lead us ; for, barring his failure to consider the basic cost of overcoming resistance, his conception is more than comprehensive, and if we rearrange his factors we shall see that what he has proposed is to include the environment with the reaction , the crucible with its contents, and in addition has added one of the expected products, namely Capital.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:span text:style-name="T18">Labor</text:span>, or effort, is vital and under self -government (as will be shown more fully later), is measurable in terms of population and is therefore a true primary factor.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:span text:style-name="T18">Raw -material</text:span> cannot be measured</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P29">* At this stage in the argument the normal total exertion of effort to overcome resistance, in a region of self-imposed order , is assumed to be constant in relation to population . If a scientific unit is available, Time may also be used to measure relative effectiveness.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:span text:style-name="T18">Ground</text:span> is land-area, constant and measurable, a true primary factor.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P30"><text:span text:style-name="T18">Time</text:span> is also constant and measurable , and therefore a true primary factor . </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P30"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P30"><text:span text:style-name="T18">Tools</text:span> are a useful part of capital and capital is obviously a product of energy - not a primary factor -- as Gide himself agrees. 14</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:span text:style-name="T18">Environment</text:span> is space and matter, both of them quite important conceptions, but clearly not subject to concrete measurement.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">A rearrangement of these factors put forward by Gide may now be made as follows :</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P31">The field of action</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">Environment and Raw -Material, or space and matter. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33"><text:span text:style-name="T18">The factors of action</text:span> </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">Labor, Ground and Time.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P32">The Product </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P33">Freedom or Value (of which so-called Capital is one important but much over-emphasized item ) .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Thus Gide gives us clear- sightedly the three measurable factors we need , but beclouds his dawning logic by throwing in too generously, first, the environment, which is not susceptible of measurement, and, second, a partial product which is not worth measuring ; for if economics is a science, its essentials existed before its consequences.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P66">With all these interesting contributions, there was also much in the way of devout star-gazing, with a consequent introduction of factors such as &quot; natural-bounty,&quot; &quot; natural- forces&quot; and &quot; social- products,&quot; which to the engineer appear too meta physical to be used to vindicate the claim that economics is a science. In addition to all these, through thick and thin , there has been the disposition already noted to dwell upon the importance of capital. Capital is an important product of economic forces but not a primary factor. This cannot be too strongly emphasized .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Now , out of all these contributions to our list of primary factors, which can be measured ? Obviously , only land -area with a foot-rule, population by a census and time by a chronometer . With this list of basic factors which can be calibrated, economics begins to look distinctly interesting to the engineer,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">who was apt to grow a little melancholy under the purely comparative approximations of psychology and metaphysics.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">We must remember that we are sitting outside in the sun and have withheld judgment for the moment as to the value of the ancient formulÊ . We are dealing with superficial speculations which claim the rank of science; but we have found that all just appraisement is halted by the lack of a logical unit of value.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34">Let us now try to get a clear picture of the economic field . The simplest conception is that of a closed vessel with two main ports or valves : first, that of birth or ingress, with an intermediate pressure -chamber or lock, walled off by humanity for tender youth , and second, that of death or egress, approached by its own intermediate pressure-chamber of old age. All that enters or leaves this main high -pressure area is the spirit, that human unit of energy with its normal positive rotation, quick or sluggish as the case may be, but driven ever by its need of physical freedom and lured by its inducement to amplify that freedom . This unit may be expressed by Figure 1 , as a miniature organism always revolving and always tend ing to expand by centrifugal force (see page 53 ). </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34">The whole economic zone itself, with its fixed base of land and its unyielding boundary of time, is like some gigantic gas tank , such as we see in every city, capable of rising inch by inch as the effective effort increases. Curiously enough, it is Jevons, the mathematician, who quotes with approval Bastiat&apos;s description of the economic circle as being expressed by Wants, Efforts, Satisfaction .15</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">This, however, is only a partial truth - a misleading detail in the cycle. What we require for comprehension under democracy, or a zone of self-imposed order, is a general phrase as follows:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34">Effort - Value -- Freedom .16 </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34">&quot; Wants, Efforts, Satisfaction &quot; is a closed circle of no further economic value, since it involves <text:span text:style-name="T18">satiety</text:span> -- a sensation which , whether we like to think so or not, has little place in democracy .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34">Economics, as pictured by the phrase, &quot;Wants, Efforts, Satisfaction ,&quot; gives too sharply the picture of an animal searching for food and, having exerted that effort, lying down fully gorged . It is most interesting that this image should have proved satisfactory to a school of political-economists who were deeply concerned with capital as a prime factor. &quot; Wants , efforts, satisfaction &quot; provides no capital: everything is consumed , unless there is an invisible figure in the picture blessing the God-given &quot; wants,&quot; minimizing the &quot; satisfaction&quot; and discreetly storing up a little capital with each daily round of the &quot; economic man &quot; who exerts the vital &quot; effort.&quot; Possibly their failure to paint in the central figure is due simply to the fact that political-economists are not scientists, but in the nature of the case are rather humble loyalists who have not ventured into the middle of the picture. </text:p>

Labor, in this tableau, is the lean choreman who tends the hen , and for his share receives a disappointing portion of these variable -sized eggs, which are set apart in a &quot;wage-fund.&quot; Capital is the hen herself -- a magnificent white super-hen , waxing ever fatter on a diet of the crumbled yellow yolks of her own hard-boiled eggs, together with the product of the land on which she rests ; and this land, to make up for its fail</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P70">more useful approximations of the economic field than the highly colored picture of the sacred hen. They are, at any rate, easier to deal with in scientific terms which can be generally applied.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">We have found then that our only <text:span text:style-name="T18">measurable</text:span> factors are population , land -area and time; and realizing that these define density , volume and duration of effort, with the very general conception of the unquenchable human desire for individual freedom as the motive force, the interest of the engineer is further quickened. Economics begins to have some of the familiar aspects of a science.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">To approach economics with a tally - sheet for population , a steel tape for measuring area and a trustworthy chronometer, may appear completely heartless to a fervid sociologist ; but it is no more heartless than the response by an intelligent administrator to an appeal from a fever-stricken district when he sends in a surveyor with his instruments with a view to drain age. For those whose children are tossing in fever, the benevolent quack , or sympathetic clergyman &apos;s wife with chicken soup and jelly, may seem much more adequate response; but we have suffered in economics too much already from soup and jelly .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34">At any rate, we have reached the point where we have thre<text:span text:style-name="T21">e </text:span>measurable factors to work with . Now let us see whether the employment of these is rank heresy. As a matter of fact, Labor, including both mental and physical effort, has been validated by most of the sound economists. The only innovation proposed is to give it free way, as democracy designed, and measure it by population . Land- area, or room , has been specifically emphasized by Charles Gide. The <text:span text:style-name="T18">value</text:span> of this area with which the single-taxers are so much concerned is measured justly, not by appraisers in terms of a fluctuating unit of value, but, under democracy, by the free population at tracted within its boundaries. The factor of Time has been put forward positively by Bˆhm -Bawerk , Jevons and Fisher.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34">If there is an appearance of heresy it is due to the fact that all imponderable factors have been rejected ; and it is insisted that if the three factors, Labor, Land and Time, are basic they shall have the right to appear at all points and not be relegated to special uses in argument. Curiously enough , while the three eminent economists mentioned above, with their quantitative aspirations, are all eager to discuss the factor of Time at one point or another, they appear to regard it, not as co -important with Land and Labor, but more as a special factor to be used in gauging the rights of capital in terms of interest. We have no concern at the moment with capital, which is one partial <text:span text:style-name="T21">resultant of the interactions of Labor, Land, and Time.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34">Jevons is distinctly encouraging, and there is good reason to invite the unconventional approach of the engineer : &quot; But I believe that dynamical branches of the science of economy may remain to be developed, on the consideration of which I have not at all entered.&quot; 17</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34">And further : &quot; The notion of value is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to our science what that of energy is to mechanics.&quot; 18</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34">Now the justifiable contention of the engineer is that with the advent of democracy , or self-imposed order, and the liberation of effort within fixed political boundaries, economic value became obviously dynamic, and we must rearrange all our conceptions. At that stage in economic history newly freed forces came into play within specific limits, and all the factors of dynamics are necessarily involved thenceforward. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P34">The laws of dynamics deal with forces and motion , and cover both statics and kinetics. What in the last analysis must human effort confined within the orderly limits of democracies ? How can we measure <text:soft-page-break/>the duration or effectiveness of liberated human effort within such an area without the use of time? How shall specific value be measured except by the free ex pression of effort, just as potential difference is measured ? In the very simplest terms the value of a slice of bread can only be measured by the orderly effort free men will expend to reach it after being galvanized by time in terms of desire.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P71">gold -outcroppings might, if we had suitable instruments, be measured by the &quot;moment&quot; of the two forces of need and desire, with the resultant &quot; torsion &quot; on the hungry man who stands halfway between the bread and the prospect. <text:span text:style-name="T18">And the interesting thing to realize is that we have not only a suitable instrument; but a most accurate instrument, namely , a dial which is national area , graduated in terms of population -density, with the very sensitive indicator of individual ownership . To the question &quot;What is a thing worth ? &quot; the answer is the tax-paid , fractional area enriched by population which is placed in jeopardy to secure it, with the full knowledge that no political power can alter the dial.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Surely, the obligation laid upon the economist is the study of the control, measurement, development and distribution of human energy, whether the product of that energy is capital, utility , wealth , or human happiness ; and this is still more urgent and obvious if the net resultant should be a minus one, or human wastage and misery. Energy can never be measured in terms of its product; and it cannot even be approximated if our archaic conventions tend to baffle and impede it. The value of human energy and its various resultants cannot possibly be measured except in a region of self-determined order ,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and then only in terms of its ultimate fixed limits -- Population (defining density ), Land (defining volume), and Time (defining duration of effort) .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Now if these three fundamental and measurable factors were actually employed to measure potential value : to assess individual responsibility in terms of taxation (the cost of order) ; and to calculate the total resulting value, and the fractional values which are expressed by our currency ; there might be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">some ground for claiming a scientific basis for applied economics ; but to delegate today, exactly as we did in the days of autocracy , the incidence of taxation to fallible, arbitrary and incompetent human judgment; the final control of the resulting value to private or alien owners of massed gold ; and the calculation of our necessary currency to political agents, who cannot keep their hands on these owners, is as little scientific as can be.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P66">Political- economists may claim that their careful examination of the precise products of several indeterminable factors has been conducted in a scientific manner and has many interesting results ; but the scientist can only look on the whole performance as a morbid and useless diversion . What the latter misses is any hope of closing an equation , even in the most general terms.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sanity, or wholeness -- is not this, in the end, the confusing lack in economics; and is it not this lack which leaves such phenomena as interest, rent, taxation and currency absolutely unrelated to basic economic value, so that when a political economist reasserts that the art of taxation is the art of getting</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the feathers without the squawk , we are almost disposed to grant him the rank of scientist without further question, though all he has earned is the rank of cynic ? 19</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Under our present system the final determination of value is left to international owners ofmassed gold , while taxation , - the cost of overcoming resistance, - and currency,-- th<text:span text:style-name="T22">e </text:span>measure and pledge of value, -- are still as subject to the whim of an uneducated legislator, guided perhaps by some sentimental dealer in political junk who wrongly calls himself an economist, as they were to the caprice or needs of an astute autocrat. All these authorities are likely to go wrong for totally different reasons : The controller of massed gold operates internationally : the legislator is not always held by scientific compunction : the political- economist 20 has no unit of value ; and while politically we are free of the autocrat, we are , nevertheless, still jerked to our knees at intervals by the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P35">sudden strictures of the international gold -standard . </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P35"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P35">Because of lack of comprehension of the measurable basic factors of national value- land-area , population and time many civilized countries today stand panic -struck . Essential</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">* A very definite distinction should be drawn between the political economist and the economist proper. The political- economist, like the astrological-astronomer , the alchemistic -metallurgist, the centaur and the mermaid , is almost bound to disappear, as we recognise the dynamic significance of national equilibrium , or self-determination .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P66">value, based on these factors, is ample for all reparation , all liquidation and a new start. We crouch frozen with fear, because we are poor in terms of gold and the world &apos;s voluminous currency has been diluted till ( in terms of gold ) it has little so -called value . We have hypnotized ourselves by look</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ing too long fixedly at a small pyramid of burnished bullion which for the present stands fenced in the centre of ample fields encircled by waiting labor.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">What peace we enjoy is the stillness of bewilderment, but it holds many intimations of stampede. The more orderly nations, if circumstances are not too much for them , are still held by the threadbare convention of the dominance of gold; but gold , as an arbiter of value, will be repudiated when it is fully realized by those who suffer rather than gain by the convention, that it interposes arbitrary barriers to the free flow of human effort. It does not need a historian - it does not need even the oldest inhabitant -- to predict what is going to happen , when crevice after crevice appears in a long-standing dam subject to increasing pressure, even though it has per formed the utmost service in the past.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P36">If, today, in countries such as Germany and Austria , it could be realized that the value of land-area and order could be set against their enormous volume of currency, and their unit expressed in terms of square feet - or square inches, for that matter - of national territory of average population-density , definitely linked with their proportionate responsibility for the maintenance of order, then both marks and kronen would become unimpairable tokens of national value, and internal activity would be accelerated by confidence . And the difference between the United States and these unfortunate countries is only one of degree.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">CHAPTER IV</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">A DYNAMIC THEORY OF ECONOMICS</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">This theory is arrived at by taking certain elementary precautions in considering the problem of economic value, which is apparently complex , but, if considered generally , is parallel to all other values arising from motion or effort within measurable limits. The only difference is that instead of dealing with solar energy , electric energy or radio -activity, we are endeavoring to measure human effort in the medium of matter, - a phase of effort, which, in spite of its egoistic springs, has, in a region of self-imposed order, a calculable flow , impelled by the bare need of physical freedom , and induced by the reward of ampler freedom .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Upon this assumption, at the risk of seeming ungrateful,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">let us ignore, for the moment, the brilliant and painstaking work of the economists -- admitting at the same time, in their dogged hold on wriggling politico -economic phenomena, they have actually so hemmed within a limited area the data we are seeking, that there is some point of contact with each of them if we step boldly into the space which they now surround shoulder to shoulder in their zealous approach from every direction .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Since human effort is the vital force with which economics is concerned , let us see whether , in the consideration of certain of its phases, by using primary factors which are measurable , some simple formulÊ may not be arrived at; and then , be cause of the employment of common terms, whether these</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">formulÊ may not be fittingly assembled as a basic theory capable of general application :</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">First. That land-area , population and time, in a region of self-imposed order , are the basic factors, or limits, of economic value.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37">If economic value is the freedom arising from effective human effort, in the medium of matter , then there are only two basic contributing agencies mathematically involved in its measurement: one is the prime impulse which springs from need or inducement ; the other is resistance. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37">However , if we desire to take advantage of scientific procedure in the art of measurement, we must be able to state both impulse and resistance in terms of common dimensions before the resulting value can be measured . These dimensions, or limits, are human effort, area and time, which express potential motive- force ; and loss -of-human -effort, area and time, which express resistance.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The surprising fact is that such a contention is only novel in one branch of science -- the so -called science of economics. The economists usually state that land, labor and capital are the elements of economic value; but, from a scientific standpoint, capital can be resolved into several basic factors, and to consider it as an element is to maintain the confusion which it introduces into all calculations. Superficially everyone is agreed that land and labor are basic elements; let us consider then what capital is, so that we can dispose of its primary claim . The usual example given by the political- economists is that if a man is about to commence any operation , he has to consider three basic costs, namely, rent, wages and interest.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37">For the sake of argument let us assume the following : </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37">Rent is the value bid for land -area per unit of time. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37">Wages are the value bid for human effort per unit of time. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37">Interest is the value bid for money (or certified value) per unit of time. 1</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37">Now let us suppose that capital is not available, as is often the case outside the economic textbooks ; how shall it be created if it is essential? Obviously by the operator in question applying his own labor per unit of time, directly or indirectly , upon land, consuming less than he produces, as does the persistent leaser in preparation for a farm of his own . He pays rent and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">* It seems pertinent to point out that Taxation , the value bid for order per unit of time, is not included by the ritualists ; and that what they call rent is often the payment for depreciating goods; but let us withhold these exceptions for the time being . Compare page 135 et seq .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P72">exerts effort, limited by time. He now turns again to his de sired undertaking and, once more, figures rent and wages together with the interest on his painfully acquired capital, so that the estimate of his costs works out as follows : Rent per year for land, wages per year for labor and interest per year for his accumulated capital. But this capital, as we have seen , was the product of his own labor per year upon land, so that we have only three elementary factors involved which are themselves measurable, namely effort, the source of all value, which may be measured as a whole by population, Land , the area within which that effort is confined ; and Time, the measure of its duration . </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P37">In reality, capital is a product designed purely for consumption , and has its dynamic function as an inducement of effort, or else it is a depreciating facility , justly credited (while it lasts ) , to its creator, capable of accelerating the flow of effort which may be thwarted by its lack . Let us take the electric</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38">broiling of a squab to illustrate an inducement of effort; and the electric welding of a street- car track to illustrate a facilitation of effort. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38">Having shown briefly that capital is not an element, but a secondary product of effort limited by land -area and time, within the theater of Nature, let us consider separately these</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P38"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"><text:span text:style-name="T18">Land</text:span> . The importance of this factor rests upon the circumstance that it cannot be increased by any art or policy within the given political boundaries with which democracy has to deal. For the measurement of effort it provides a simple factor in square inches, namely area, which , in combination with population is what we need to ascertain the &quot; occupancy-value,&quot; &quot; pressure,&quot; &quot; head,&quot; or &quot; potential,&quot; whichever we care to call it. However, in speaking of land the same kind of unscientific confusion has crept into economics that we have found i<text:span text:style-name="T23">n </text:span>discussing capital. The only constant and measurable quality of land is its superficial area, and the importance of this varies with population , exactly as the importance of the area of any other physical container of energy varies with pressure. Gide perceives this when he defines the factor which he calls &quot; ground &quot; as &quot; a superficial extension . . . a certain space , were it only to stand on,&quot; adding, &quot;now this question of &apos;room &apos; becomes very serious as soon as the population of a country has grown sufficiently dense.&quot; 2 </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38">Many political-economists of the alchemist type are inclined to complicate this definite mathematical quality of land with other values , liberated by past labor, which are either general facilities resulting in the elimination of friction, or else are justly -owned capital, or stored effort. In either case , owing to inevitable duplication or decay, they are impossible to measure scientifically except by the free flow of population ; and they lead us into endless difficulties if we attempt to measure them in any other way.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The trouble with the romantic economists is that they cannot mentally separate their quart measure and other people &apos;s strawberries. The added capital- values of realized effort have been bought, sold and exchanged in good faith : they have nothing to do with the initial flow of human effort, though they have a great deal to do with its subsequent effectiveness and its <text:span text:style-name="T18">path</text:span> .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Nearly all the advocates of single -tax contributed to this error : Patrick Edward Dove includes with land, the mines, the forests and the fisheries; Sir John Macdonell includes mines ; Edward McGlynn speaks of the &quot; natural bounties which God gave to the community in the beginning&quot; ; Thomas G . Shearman includes &quot; natural advantages&quot; ; and Fillebrown emphasizes &quot; natural resources such as gold , silver, copper, iron and coal mines, oil fields and water powers&quot; -- and then performs a complete somersault and instead of classifying them as divine favors, includes them with those &quot; social products which make ground rent a special privilege.&quot; It is a most misleading error and is what has stood so long <text:soft-page-break/>in the way of just taxation.

As a point of elementary logic, if we reverently credit these realized advantages to the Creator, or to society , we should then , less reverently , debit to the same accounts the lost lives of prospectors who have died of thirst, the scattered savings of over hopeful mining investors, the costly dry wells of the oil operator, and the disastrous financial record of railroads which have prematurely reached out for timber and similar raw material. The clay of yesterday becomes the aluminum ore of tomorrow . </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38">Is this change due to natural bounty or human effort ? These things are neither &quot; social products&quot; nor spasmodic gifts of God. From an economic standpoint they are phases of our environment to be made available for use only by the expenditure of new mental or physical effort , governed by the limitation of time and the fixed area of land.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38">Gide, even though he uses Environment and Raw -material as factors, saw this clearly , and states, &quot; thus even with wealth which is termed natural, labor is seen to be a real agent of production ; for without it such objects would be virtually non existent for us.&quot; 3 </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P38">Area, then , is measurable, and thus qualifies as a valid quantitative factor. Other land-values are not measurable ; but it should be obvious that they contribute to the basic importance of land-area by attracting another accurately measurable factor - population -- thus creating the clean resultant we desire , that is, occupancy -value.4</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P39">Land-area , then, is not value ; but it is a measurable dimension of value. </text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P39"><text:span text:style-name="T18">Labor</text:span>. This factor has been defined by economists with the utmost finality and prejudice in some cases, and with the utmost caution and open -mindedness in others. Adam Smith calls it the original purchase money that was paid for all things. Gide rejects it as a measure of value because we have no dynamometer by which to measure it. <text:span text:style-name="T24">5</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">With this significant word &quot; dynamometer&quot; he showed that he saw what was needed ; but he concludes that we have to be content with gold and silver as measures of value, though he states that we may try to rectify the errors to which they give rise.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The Physiocrats reserved the term labor almost purely for the gleaning of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">products of land, disregarding more important mental effort. Fourier , the economist, distinguishes between attractive labor and painful labor, as though the functions of the North and South magnetic poles had some competitive claim to consideration -- yet he was very close to an important truth ! 6 Karl Marx insists that the value of any article is the amount of labor necessary for its production, and that <text:span text:style-name="T18">value</text:span> is human labor crystallized . Value is so definitely human labor in motion that this is very like insisting upon hydraulic value being delivered at the tradesman&apos;s entrance in forms of blocks of ice , so that it may be weighed and measured.<text:span text:style-name="T24">7</text:span> Marx came much nearer the simple truth when he stated that the quantity of labor is measured by its duration.

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">As one of the three basic factors by which to measure value, what is now put forward is human effort, whether mental or physical.8 Human effort is the phase of energy which lies at the core of our whole economic problem . It is what we want to measure and utilize, exactly as the problem of the scientist is the measurement and utilization of electricity or radio - activity.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Extra -effort, beyond that required for the immediate sus</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tenance of the individual, goes into an intermediate reservoir and becomes capital, an advantageous product ; and this is a very important consequence of effort, since much of the re mainder, being expended to satisfy immediate need, is similar to that physical energy known to the engineer as &quot; lost work,&quot; which, while vital, is apparently consumed in overcoming resist ance. The major problem in the art of good government is to have the surplus which is gained from individual extra-effort , and is deposited in the reserve fund of capital, justly measured and promptly handed to the individual upon demand -- not, as in the old fairy tales , left sticking to the measure, or diluted , as it is today, by the issue of countless additional tokens of value, with nothing behind them except political optimism and a sys tem of taxation that was devised long before economic justice was dreamed of.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Labor, or human effort, is clearly limited by population . If there is no population there is no effort, so that the zero point of effort and population is common to each ; and, but for our errors in economic adjustment and our attempts to rectify these politically , it is safe to say that human effort is</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">∑ Jevons states as follows: &quot; Practically man does nothing but pull, push, lift, press, carry or otherwise mechanically force things into new forms or new places.&quot; He appears here to lay insufficient stress upon a still more vital contribution to value. Man also thinks, and thus avoids much</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pulling , pushing, lifting and carrying . However, in summing up, he recognizes this and states : &quot;Science makes muscular energy the key to our vast stores of material energy.&quot; -- &quot; The Principles of Economics,&quot; pages 69 and</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fore it was confined ; but while potential human effort is proportional to population , its full physical effectiveness cannot be developed except by the autocratic state. This is the fact that lies behind the primitive worship of &quot; efficiency .&quot; It was such so -called &quot; efficient&quot; utilization of human effort that built the costly Pyramids. An operation of this nature is paralleled in applied physics by the placer -miner &apos;s use of hydraulic energy. He confines a river in a limited area and leads it, as though in chains, for great distances, so that when liberated under control it does the work of a giant. Obviously , all that is gained at the culmination of this operation is lost to the intermediate spaces. The development of available human effort dreamed of by democracy is much more nearly parallel to the conversion of potential hydraulic value into electric -power , to be sent back for equitable advantageous use on all the intervening terraces.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P31">Labor, or human effort, under what we call democracy , can only be compelled through need or induced by reward .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Need and reward,<text:span text:style-name="T25">9</text:span> or necessity and inducement -- these, then , are the two poles of human effort, respectively negative and positive ; and as far as calculation is concerned, have the gratifying effect of polarity, swinging adverse inclinations into uniformity so that they may be measured. This determination of direction gives rise to what the engineer calls the &quot; sense&quot; of a force.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Any socialistic attempt to destroy these poles-- to remove necessity, impair reward and quite literally ignore sense promises speedy confusion ; and our present efforts at political adjustment are so nearly socialistic that the consequence<text:span text:style-name="T25">s </text:span>are very costly . Owing to our misconception as to the nature of value, we thwart it at the outset and then try to offset this by various devices which only result in further friction . As</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P66">Gide puts it, &quot; consequently every system which will tend to reduce individual energy will not stand a great chance of gaining anything especially advantageous from collective enterprises, however ingeniously they may be organized.&quot; 10</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P40">Only with the two poles of necessity and inducement left unimpaired can labor or human effort be depended upon , and subsequently measured as a whole, in terms of population. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P40"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P40">The contention that population is one of the prime factors of economic value may appear to be heresy for it disregards Malthus 11 who with a bland assertion that increase in sustenance tends to be arithmetical as compared with a geometrical increase in population, laid down a so -called &quot; law &quot; which has acted as a red flag long after the supposed danger has been proved to be imaginary. This red flag still flies, but it is getting bleached and frayed. Malthus knew little about the enduring mental labor of the scientist who , while he does not create, is able through accurate measurement to eliminate friction . Invention was in its infancy ; and Malthus never dreamed of such a thing as the fixation of nitrogen , which is an effective step toward the synthesis of food. The carbon , phosphorus and potash in the grain of wheat have always returned quickly to the earth from which they came , but nitrogen , that outlaw element, was still playing truant in the days of Malthus. Since then we have learned that with the directing intellectual labor of a few men , all we require to resocialize nitrogen is the skilled utilization of Time- six months&apos; evaporation of sea water and six months&apos; precipitation of snow upon the mountains. By this use of natural tides we can come near doubling the yield of an acre planted to wheat, and bring into bearing many millions of acres which have never grown wheat. Such contributions as these are not merely limited and immediate gifts : they are steps in our physical and intellectual emancipation, with consequences which multiply even faster than popu</text:p>

If we are to do any sound economic measuring whatever, we must take cognisance of time, otherwise our so -called economics will continue to be a pathetic mixture of complacency, protest and dreams-- a medley of as imaginative factors as ever the alchemists used when fire and life were regarded as chemical elements. Our present so -called &quot;basic &quot; element of capital is just as unscientific, and the factors called &quot;Nature,&quot; &quot; natural</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">To introduce into the elementary economic problem of measuring the value of effort in a region of order, unmeasurable factors of past time and dead labor, and to depend for effective - flow upon the wing-dams of social and legislative debris, is almost beyond characterization . Our present text book factors are a charge for land -area , enriched by the fruits of past labor, which we call rent; a charge for labor, which we call wages; and a charge for the product of land, past time and past labor, which we call interest- all expressed in terms of a vague fluctuating unit -- and with these we have a liberal</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sprinkling of herbs and simples . The political- economists , the moralists and the politicians, between them , have arrived at formulÊ in which the flavors of cupidity , resignation , per plexity, luck and legerdemain are so mixed that the engineer is fully justified in adding them to his museum where aqua vitÊ , the philosophers&apos; stone and the other objects of the black arts lie covered with dust.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">And yet <text:span text:style-name="T18">time</text:span>, of all our factors, seems to have so much of the quality of magic that it is no wonder the economists were inclined to regard it with suspicion. The moralists looked on it as a gift ofGod which it would be impious to examine ; the emancipated materialists could not see either the beginning or the end of it, and were not going to be diverted by any thing so intangible. Even now it seems to be the only gift left out of all we hoped for from the fairies ; and yet, for each individual unit of the human race it is not so intangible a factor after all; we walk across our allotted span and come to the far edge as we might traverse an estate the exact period of time is recorded on our tombstones, and there is no guesswork about that.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The so -called &quot; increment&quot; of time is constant, and in an ideal community, where equities are observed , should measure a general dividend available in proportion to our capacity to co-ordinate ourselves, though it is obvious that we grant this dividend at present as a kind of riparian right to the holders of thickly -populated land-area, without assessing pro rata responsibility. These beneficiaries in turn are raided at intervals by the international owners of massed gold - our disastrous fetish .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42">It has not been customary to regard time as an essential factor by which to measure economic value, and yet it is so clearly a definite limit that it seems almost foolish to set seriously about establishing the validity of its mathematical claim . If any basic calculations are to be attempted, it is fatuous to ignore it : neither resistance, duration of effort, nor interest, which expresses effective current value, can be determined except by employing the factor of time. Just as effective heat, electricity and weight in motion are measured respectively in calories per hour, kilowatt-hour or foot-pound - seconds, so interest, the current value of freedom , can only be measured in population-area-hours. It is worthy of note that as engineers make their tentative contributions to economics, they cannot speak of effort apart from time as a basic factor of value.15 They, at any rate, trained to reason quantitatively , cannot think of labor, or human effort, in any terms whatever without introducing the factor of time. They seem , however, to miss an equally important point by failing to realize that the area in which effort is exerted is just as necessary a factor of measurement as the time in which it is exerted. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P42">The basic character of time as a factor of value is one of the elementary economic truths which has been approached so closely by economists from different starting points that the marvel is they never seized and harnessed it.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Charles Gide, also, acknowledged the factor of time and came almost in sight of Henry George as he was backing away. He states, &quot; Time . . . is one of the essential conditions of all production &quot; and &quot;man&apos;s activity is limited by time as much as by space ( sic ). No act of production can be instantaneous. We shall see that this condition . . . far from being purely metaphysical has consequences which are of serious economic importance and of great practical interest.&quot; 17 This is very adequate support, but it is necessary to point out that where the word space is used as a limit of activity , what must be meant is measurable area : space limits nothing.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P43">Professor Irving Fisher constantly employs the factor of time, as, for example, when he speaks of interest &quot;being the link which binds man to the future.&quot; What other link is there between the present and future but time itself, and what can interest be but a measure of the importance of the interval in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43">hours ? Again, &quot; Time . . . is required. Nature is slow in yielding up her treasures. This slowness of nature, in view of man &apos;s impatience to exploit her, will give rise to a rate of interest.&quot; And finally, &quot; In fact, if we were asked to state in a word why there is interest, we should reply, because nature is slow and keeps men waiting.&quot; 20 </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P43">Bˆhm -Bawerk actually got time into his laboratory, but he appears to use it chiefly as a factor to measure short and long cycles of production . His statements that there is a loss of time involved in the employment of capital are repeated and specific, such as, &quot; the disadvantage connected with the capitalist method of production is its sacrifice of time&quot; and &quot; . . . the loss of time which is bound up with the capitalist process . . . &quot; 21</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Since he also emphasizes immediately the accelerated production which results from the employment of capital, the words&quot; loss&quot; and &quot; sacrifice&quot; are altogether too weighted with prejudice. If he had said that the greater cycles involved in capitalist production called for the aid of extra-effort, or extra</text:p>

We have, in economics, been so long fed on mysticism that we still cling to our dwindling deities, no matter how slow . It is really unfair to blame poor Nature for a high rate of looked after Cain and Abel and Adam : &quot; Do hurry, Mother !&quot; Scientifically , we have a rate of interest for the same reason that we have continuous electric lights , because freedom , in a region of order, has a current value ; not because Mother Nature is slow and has to be bribed with</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P77">neither sympathy nor apology. He is not referring to the lapse of time as a factor, butas an outrage to capital which can only be wiped out by the indemnity of interest.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44">His example of the sewing machine shows that with the aid of this implement the tailor can make one coat in one day, but without it he can only make one coat in three days. The &quot; loss&quot; of time in this example is based on the fact that it took &quot; considerably longer than three days&quot; to make the sewing machine ! </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44">If time has any virtue as a mathematical factor in this example , it is obvious that when the machine has made 1000 coats there is a saving of two days per coat, or nearly six years. Bˆhm -Bawerk anticipated such an objection by saying it would not be relevant in resisting his claim that there is any &quot; sacrifice&quot; of time involved. It may not be respectful, but it is relevant. What the engineer sees clearly is that there is made possible a most profitable facilitation of effort, and interest, therefore, is quite naturally offered for these facilities by competitive bidders who wish to seize such an opportunity . </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44">Jevons also sees the significance of time, and states, &quot; I would say then , in the most general manner , that whatsoever improvements in the supply of commodities lengthen the average interval between the moment when labor is exerted and its ulti mate result or purpose accomplished , such improvements depend upon the use of capital.&quot; 22 </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P44">As with Bˆhm -Bawerk, he sees the significance of time, but also unfortunately expresses it as though there were greater expenditure of time than gain . It may be regarded as a greater expenditure of time per cycle of operation ; but it is so clearly a less expenditure per unit produced that to speak of lengthening instead of shortening is quite misleading. A simpler statement of the same thing would give a much greater significance to the importance of time as a factor, namely, any extended</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cycle of operation designed to utilize current effort to the full requires capital; in short, that to make current value per hour most effective we must employ every facility.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P66">any subsequent investigator who claims that time is a vital factor, with his expressed suspicion that the dynamic interpretation of economics may be worth looking into ; with his admitted long bewilderment, which he finally claims to have solved, that the factor of time is not involved in all his calculations ; and with this sweeping statement, &quot; Following out this course of thought we shall arrive at the conclusion that time enters into all economic questions. We live in time and think and act in time: we are in fact altogether the creatures of time&quot; ; but, with Gide , he grimly pulls down his hat over his eyes, at this conception of eternity without horizon , but much more impressed than Gide by his vision, goes on without pause to state soundly, &quot; accordingly it is rate of supply, rate of production, rate of consumption per unit of time that we shall be really treating.&quot; 23 </text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P45">It is difficult to regard this in conjunction with his &quot; elements&quot; 24 after all his intimations and pain of labor, as anything but a still-born climax. As with a few other econo mists, his momentum fails just as it seemed about to sweep him into the clearing which Jevons himself, more perhaps than any of them , even Charles Gide, felt strongly lay close ahead . He is halted and held by the last interwoven brambles of the economic jungle, and in exhaustion goes wearily back to telling his beads -- &quot;Utility , Wealth , Value, Commodity, Labor, Land and Capital.&quot;</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P78">Both the so -called destructive and productive processes of nature are, under a larger view , no more than rearrangement : they are material modifications of our environment. The enrichments upon which we draw so lavishly are unmeasurable changes of environment; and their apparent depletion faces us more and more grimly as we exhaust our fisheries, our lumber, our oil, coal, nitrates, potash and phosphates, to say nothing of other groupings of elements to which we have grown used and yet these very things, as consumed , have been the agents of our emancipation and their depletion seems likely to be the spur to greater emancipation . As certain commodities appear to approach exhaustion, just as free land was exhausted, or as capital has been momentarily exhausted in warring countries, we alter our plans. Destruction or reconstruction -- both of these are plainly rearrangements of environment ; but we are slowly being brought face to face with the fact that land-area, current population and current time are the only factors upon which we can depend for our basic calculations. Without knowing it, in our economic methods we are mentally living on our hump, like a camel, but it is not a basis for calculation that will carry us anywhere. If we employ such accumulations as factors with which to measure value, we are in the position of an engineer who arranges a hydro -electric plant on the basis of the water that can be drawn out of a mountain lake through a certain sized pipe in one year . What he actually does, instead, is to disregard the intermediate reservoir, knowing that it may be exhausted by a period of extra demand , and he estimates the amount of water flowing into that lake : he values it in terms of density , volume and velocity, and it is on these figures alone he bases the capacity of his power-plant and the scope of his distribution . </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P46"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P46">Time, then , is not a whimsical and intangible gift of the Creator&apos;s without shape or form ; it is a rational means of measuring the duration of normal human effort- an available factor to be treated with mystic awe or disrespect individually, but which cannot be disregarded in any basic conception of value which recognizes effort, and deals mathematically with taxation , wages, rent, interest or delayed exchange. If there is any economist still prepared to deny the function of time as a prime factor of value, it is because he continues to think of scientific economic value as something that will make a noise in a money-box .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Time, by itself, is not value ; but, in combination with land area and population , it constitutes the final measurable dimension of value.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Second. That under democracy human effort has been freed from arbitrary control.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">To avoid discussion, the word democracy is used solely for the purpose of distinguishing our present system of government, in which order is self -imposed , from other systems , such as theocracy or autocracy, in which order is superimposed. The assertion that human effort has been freed for individual use is almost self -evident. The edicts of Turgot, the pronouncements of the French Revolution , the Declaration of Independence and the Proclamation of Emancipation were formal statements of this fact. We must not forget, however, that if land-area , population and time are basic factors, and we can shake off the dominating delusion that value may be measured by a commodity, the control of any one of these three basic factors means the effective control of the others. Nevertheless, since slavery was abolished , both convention and law permit the individual to do exactly as he pleases, within the limits of community safety , with his time and effort. The tramp or hobo may be a nuisance , but he is not a criminal under our code. The sentimental political (and politico -economic ) re<text:span text:style-name="T27">formers immediately counter that he only free to do as he </text:span>pleases within very narrow limits , and the land-owner holds him on a leash . If we are quite sure that it is really the land owner who holds the end of the leash under our present system , we may admit this as a matter for careful attention without denying that we have deliberately utilized our political power to abolish slavery and thus free to each man the full value of his effort. If unfortunately we have left the individual hobbled through economic <text:soft-page-break/>shortsightedness, inadvertance or sheer delusion, it does not make our political intention any less specific .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">In abolishing slavery, what we said in effect was that any individual might work as long and hard or as short and lightly as he pleased, as though a court-of-law were to grant to the owner of some mountain meadow full title to all the passing water he could use on his own land for all time.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Third. <text:span text:style-name="T18">That free human effort varies according to population .</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Under absolutely efficient autocratic control, physical labor would obviously vary directly in proportion to population ; that is, a definite number of slaves driven with maximum efficiency would yield a definite amount of work in one year, which could be as cleanly calculated as the amount of work to be obtained from twenty mules, one capable driver and a long whip . Mental effort, however , under autocracy could not be so calculated on or coerced, and that was one of the wasteful leaks in the in adequate pressure pipe of the autocratic system .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Under popular government the ratio of effort to population should be more direct than under autocracy , provided foolish political provisions are not made to dull the goad of necessity or impair the integrity of inducement. The goad of necessity covers all current needs, and adequate inducement will provide that extra -effort on which the community depends for a reserve and a guaranty of continuity. It is no longer the crack of the whip upon which we must depend for the creation of reserves, nor the autocratically supported edicts of Joseph , but the inducement of adequate and unimpairable reward. If, however , through pernicious legislative enactments, we undertake to make the community responsible for the welfare of the idle individual, we have permitted a deplorable reduction in motive</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">force ; and if we cut down reward, or make it spurious, we have added to our error at the other end of the flow , checking that spontaneous effort, whether physical or mental, upon which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P47">democracy must depend . </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P47"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P47">With necessity and inducement unimpaired, we can then count on a normal flow of effort directly proportional to population .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P66"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Fourth. <text:span text:style-name="T18">That the factor of time does not vary.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">This needs no argument.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P47">Fifth . <text:span text:style-name="T18">That within fixed political boundaries land -area does not vary.</text:span> </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P47"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P47">There is here a hopeful assumption that political limits are finally established under democracy. At any rate, for the sake of exactitude, fixed political boundaries are stipulated . The</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">delay in recognizing land -area, as a final factor, was due to the possibility of additions by seizure and conquest.25 The number of acres, however , does not vary within our present political boundaries, so that we have a fixed area within which our energy is confined. Time being constant, and movement un</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">restricted , the occupancy -value of land-area varies directly in proportion to the population.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Sixth. <text:span text:style-name="T18">That control of land -area , if permitted politically, is therefore basic economic power, giving control of effort per hour, and consequently of total value. </text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P47"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P47">Through unregulated control of land-area, toll can be taken of labor and tribute demanded of &quot; slow time.&quot; Provided no arbitrary factor is permitted to intervene, land -area then becomes the basic factor of economic power , or control of value, most subject to individual domination and for this reason democracy should be keenly interested in its pro rata responsibility , since only by this precaution can each new generation be confirmed as heir of all the ages. It is one thing for the individual to squander his birthright. We fought for that privilege. It is quite another matter for society to negligently cut him off with thirty cents .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Detached human effort, under the impersonal sufferance of time, whether properly diligent, taking advantage of lawful occasions, or frankly predatory, must come to earth with its catch or, in the end, forego it. What the community is concerned with is area, which does not flow benignly like time or fluctuate like effort. It is the fixed and immutable base upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P47">which all benefits fall. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P47"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P47">25 See page 42.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P66">Area is the only controllable factor of current value. Individual effort is not controllable, and while Time, if we invest it with personality ,may appear subject to appeal, giving us an</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P48">easy dollar for each dollar raised by effort ( like some multi millionaire philanthropist) , in reality is an inexorable factor which , not only cannot be controlled, but which , if we personally ignore, starves, kills and decomposes us and makes to land another small contribution of carbon , phosphorus and nitrogen . </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P48"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P48">If we had the One- Big -Union of which organized labor dreams, the land -owner might be inclined to doubt his basic power, or if days could be rationed out like sugar, there might be some confusion as to the dependability of time; but time is fortunately out of our hands and labor cannot be primarily controlled by any individual without the creation of a new autocracy. The human animal has grown tired of Kings, of Captains of Industry and of so -called Labor-Leaders, in exact proportion to their domination . If this becomes effective we spew them out as obstacles ; but as long as they merely represent a strong sentiment, we respect or endure them . From an intelligent reading of history we can see that the accomplishment of being spewed out with some dignity has come to be regarded as a &quot; royal&quot; attribute, whether exhibited by a Louis or a Napoleon . In the end all arbitraries go ; and our apparent respect for them , when we look back, has very much the appearance of fattening the victim for the inevitable sacrifice. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P48"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P48">The ultimate human control of economic value, then , rests logically upon the control of land-area , and this for the vital reason that land is limited in quantity and , since acquisition by conquest became unfashionable under democracy, has not been subject to unexpected and distressing duplication. Labor, limited only by time, can redouble its effort, or for awhile it can go on strike and cease entirely . No individual, whether autocrat or demagogue, can halve or double the available area of land within fixed political boundaries.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The general importance of land as an economic factor is clearly demonstrated by experience and history, and so well supported by philosophers of the caliber of Herbert Spencer and John Stuart Mill that there should be little need to argue the point; but there is one misconception, which must be emphasized again the more sentimental economists, while recognising that land is the confining area of human effort, insist also on adding persuasion to their logic. Oil, coal and metals, the rearrangements of matter ; drainage, reclamation and fertilization, the contributions of past effort- these are added by some of them to the calculable factor of area , obviously enough, in a few cases, for the purpose of making immediate community control more tempting. It is very much as if an engineer were to try to tempt prospective investors in a power -project by stating that the waters flowing through his water- right were delicately flavored with sugar and lemon , that his water-pipe was painted red , or that he knew where he could tap a few fish -ponds, and for these reasons arguing that the horsepower developed would be vastly better worth control. He would get more credit as a promoter than as an engineer. In licking their chops over the good things in land, the sentimental economists are contributing nothing to a sound solution of our problem . Many of these values, whether they are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">called &quot; site value,&quot; or &quot; social-product,&quot; are already appraised by the flow of population : others are capital, and being capitalare not only already owned , but are subject to unexpected duplication and inevitable depreciation . They cannot be regarded as fundamental economic factors, but, as put forward in this way , are simply the pseudo- reformer&apos;s vague inventory of possible loot. Scientifically they are not basic value, but rank with the conditions which help to localize value. The facility provided by a conductor of energy, such as low resistance, is not energy, but it does go toward ensuring a greater net realization of value, if the essentials of that value already exist.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P48"><text:soft-page-break/>From the standpoint of pure economics, the control of land area is control of the basic factor of national value. Population is not controllable except under autocracy, or under such bureaucracy as the modern reformer vainly dreams of. For this reason , since we are now interesting ourselves in the values arising from political freedom , we are compelled to take cognisance of land-area which defines one of the impersonal limits of this freedom . From a scientific standpoint, it is more than illogical to link the value arising from free individual effort either wholly or fractionally, to gold, any portion of which is held on deposit in this country by an irresponsible and alien government or its semi-official agents. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P48"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P48">The area of land is vital because it cannot be suddenly duplicated or withdrawn. All other so -called &quot; land-values&quot; may be substituted for, duplicated or exhausted , and represent the humus of dead years. Because of the finality of the land-area factor within the boundaries of democracy, it is capable of dominating effort and its control today would be actual sovereignty if it were not for our erratic taxation and the unscientific gold -standard tradition. Individual sovereignty, however , it must not be forgotten , is what each of us wants for himself . It is what we have been calling freedom . </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P48"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P48">Seventh . <text:span text:style-name="T18">That power and responsibility are complementary.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Here we depart apparently from physical parallels for a moment because we are dealing with a phase of energy lacking conventional phraseology, but in physics a force does make the effort of which it is capable : ethics, if the effort is beneficent, says that it should : and law , when it finally speaks, says that it must. Only with power and responsibility definitely coupled, is there any assurance of value or freedom .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P48">Ethics (which is the anti-friction compound of the human power -plant), gives us the law that power and responsibility are complementary, and from ethics it should be a very short step into law and politics; but while the approach to law can be made easily , we find often that we have to walk a great way back along a regrettable crevasse to reach political territory. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P48"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P48">In law it is covered by many enactments, the laws of trusteeship and guardianship being the most simple. We can step across the crevasse between ethics and politics on the meeting ground of employers&apos;-liability , however inequitably drafted that law has been in various places. In practical politics we have to go far further back than democracy itself for a clear sight of it ; but if we stop a moment to consider, we find the natural law automatically operative in that we suffer the consequences of an unintelligent exercise of our voting power, and for this reason we hold on grimly to the right of impeachment if our delegated power is abused . </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P48"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P48">In patriarchal days, responsibility , and the necessary power to support it, were willingly conceded to one political leader : in the days of autocracy these complementary honors were joined in the person of the king ; and if they were not wisely balanced the king lost his head. He admittedly had the power and he had no parliament to which to pass the blame, though he .often made a protesting minister his scapegoat. Our predecessors, who lived under this rudimentary form of government, may not have had the fertile mind of the modern reformer, but they recognized more clearly than we, when things went badly , that since all power was vested in one head, then all responsibility was vested in the same head. They proved it neatly more than once by terminating power and responsibility with one stroke of the axe - a very simple demonstration of the truth that power and responsibility are complementary.28</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Eighth . <text:span text:style-name="T18">That the economic responsibility of economic power (or control of value ) is taxation .</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>This may be briefly expanded for the sake of elucidation by saying that the integrity of the control of economic value is protected by order ; that value is made more effective by the creation of common facilities ; that the preservation of community order and the creation of community facilities are the</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P48">This assertion, however , may be a little hard to prove to those worthy holders of economic power who are fully conscious of their responsibility in moral terms and who, through fair dealing, just wages and generous benefactions, try to discharge their social obligations.

With the moral responsibility of these it is best to let their own consciences deal, as it is far too complex a problem for the economist : their political punishment we can leave to the consequences of their political neglect, which is followed by curtailment of personal liberty ; but their economic responsibility must be scientifically measured as some definite pro rata of a calculable whole if we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P49">are to avoid costly friction and if we are interested in the rational measurement of value. </text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">As an exercise in equity or proportion Euclid would have demonstrated this by showing that things which are proportional to the same thing are proportional to one another; but he has now had the advantage of being backed up by several generations of hard -bitten dominies, who have driven this truth into the young mind before it became conscious of vested interests and the cost of adjustment.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It appears to be inescapable; but in case the objectionable conclusion should lead us to reject our premises: that basic economic value can only be measured by the factors of land area, population and time; that economic responsibility is proportional to the control of value ; and that taxation is economic responsibility -- let us look at it from the standpoint of utility. We have potential effort confined within definite limits, and this may be measured, as a whole, in terms of population, time and area. Population increases with facilities and order, as democracy may some day prove in spite of the advocates of limited immigration and birth -control: time flows on regardless of tax experts; only land -area is subject to control. Surely, to tax the individual, either on the basis of activity or need, is to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">impair effort; so that the only rational thing to do is to assess responsibility in proportion to domination. Population is potential effort, and the control of land -area is domination . If, therefore, the value of domination varies with population and time, there can be very little question that the responsibility of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this domination, or taxation, should also vary with land-area, as modified by population and time.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Getting down again to engineering terms, if we saw fit to allow , for purposes of utilization , control of varying proportions of energy, how should we measure it and how should we assess the charge ? Not by the use to which a man put it, but by the density (population ), the flow per second ( time) , through a given cross -section (land-area ) . In a co -operative undertaking such as democracy, the proceeds of this charge should be used for patrolling our ditches (order ) and widening, deepening and extending them ( facilities) . This charge would be the scientific equivalent of just taxation , and is obviously an essential condition of effective value, since it is the basic cost of reducing resistance.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Instead of realizing that having ascertained the time by a clock and the population by a census, all that remains for purposes of equity and economy is to measure the superficial area under individual control, we tax improvements and personal property , thus impairing inducement and losing effective</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pressure ; we tax need through consumption and corporation taxes; we tax activity through licenses ; and we tax facilities and equipment through property taxes. At every point we introduce costly friction and then spend public funds in ill-considered relief. As a last inane pleasantry, we stop the flow</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P49">every year between the first of January and the fifteenth of March. The government says &quot; old family coach,&quot; and we all get up, turn around once , and sit down again . This whole business may be scientific inquisition , but it is as though a hydraulic engineer were to draw out the water ahead of his sluice-gates and hold up the vital flow , while this water was examined bacteriologically and a large amount thrown away. As economic engineers we have no reason to be very proud of our so -called system of measuring pro rata responsibility. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P49"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P49"><text:soft-page-break/>We have looked at this matter from the standpoint of equity or proportion : we have discussed it from the standpoint of practicability , as it would be dealt with by the engineer. Now let us take it into the realms of pure economic science which , as the economists assert, is fundamentally a study of the measurement of value.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Value is directly proportionate to effort and inversely proportionate to resistance. It should be obvious, therefore, that unless effort and the equilibrium which must be overcome can be definitely pre -stated in common terms there is no calculabl<text:span text:style-name="T29">e </text:span>value for the economist to deal with . A unit of economic value</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">subject to retroactive depreciation by a tax on ice cream cones and women &apos;s hats makes calculations very complicated.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P49">Tenth. <text:span text:style-name="T18">That under democracy effective effort is directly proportional to inducement. </text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P49"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P49">This anywhere but in the economic field would be a platitude; but in the mechanics of democracy it should take the same rank as one of the elementary rules of engineering : that if you diminish flow or introduce friction , you proportionately reduce effective energy. Unimpairable remuneration, the guaranty of freedom , is inducement: inducement governs effective effort ; and the maximum expression of individual human effort is our economic goal.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Now if inducement is impaired, and if rewards are allotted to idleness, it is obvious that friction has been introduced, and value diminished.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The whole question of inducement is vital to democracy, for having freed individual effort, and having done away with autocratic control, we must leave the pressure of necessity to attend to reluctant effort and employ the inducement of adequate reward to encourage willing effort. The pressure of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">necessity -- the drive of circumstance- ceases to function as soon as the immediate menace to physical freedom is over effort and resistance balance, and there is no effective surplus. The inducement of reward -- the lure of circumstance -- is all that the community can depend upon for its reserves. It is not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">then merely a moral duty to see that remuneration maintains its relative integrity : it is vital to the existence of the community . If there are any citizens willing to create a surplus, they must be encouraged and protected ; and if at the period of their extra-effort they do not require either goods or services, we must ask ourselves searchingly what we can offer. What they desire is freedom to move protected by some definite pledge which will maintain its relative integrity and be immediately honored in time of need. They ask for a pledge of value and we give them a very vague assurance of political discretion subject to impairment by taxation. They have, for a definite time, put forth extra-effort, thus enriching the fixed area of land. To guarantee a just return for this extra-effort, we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P49">must take the basic unimpairable factors of potential value into our reckoning, together with the basic cost of making this potential value effective, which we call taxation . </text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P49"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P49">This is a direct corollary of the previous argument, since</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P49">nothing that is subject to impairment is adequate inducement for that effort upon which democracy depends. We have very recently learned that our present tokens of value are capable of partial repudiation ; that the year&apos;s surplus effort, which went into the purchase of a solemn community obligation , such as a Liberty bond, will only purchase six months&apos; similar effort,27 and that even though this obligation will ultimately be redeemed at its &quot; face value,&quot; the same number of dollars returned may well be worth much less than they were to the lender originally. The vital significance of <text:soft-page-break/>this debasement is that our so -called tokens of value are not tokens of value at all, since they are not based upon ultimate measurable factors. We have abandoned the support of autocratic power and failed to enlist the support of democratic order . </text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P66">the same basic factors. The impairment of our token of value during war was roughly balanced by the fact that some of those who controlled land -area in the presence of population could temporarily obtain , through increased rents, more effort than they expended for their land, so that part of the community</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">apparently gained what another part lost, if we disregard the shock to general confidence. There is, however, a third interest still to be heard from which has always bided its time that is the holders of massed gold , our imperial &quot; basis of value,&quot; who cannot only terrify holders of currency and those involved in extended credit, but can , through the strength of our delusions, in times of so -called depression , drive even the owner off his land.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The whole economic structure has been shaken and shifted , in the same manner but to a greater degree than formerly , with the result that many are financially bruised and ill-tempered ; and there has been a deplorable tendency to impeach democracy as an institution , or to modify it in exceedingly dangerous</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ways.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P49">The social organization, at the moment, is like a heavy-duty engine which has leaned far over on its rotting economic foundation sills. Instead of getting the foundations down to bed rock , we are shoring them up with a number of legislative timbers very subject to decay, foolishly satisfied for the moment, if we can only steady it, to accept the dangerous lack of level, the enormous friction developed by new factors of thrust and pressure and the appalling wastage of available effort. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P49"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P49">It is easy to imagine some critic saying that guaranties against debasement are not possible to make; but it is very difficult to imagine such a critic contesting the desirability of them . Now it may not be a simple matter to comprehend that, since the advent of democracy, there are unimpairable national economic factors; but that is no reason for ignoring the thing as we do. It is not viciousness, though it has many of the aspects of viciousness. It arises because of our whole hazy notion in regard to the relation of effort to remuneration , of rem<text:span text:style-name="T29">u</text:span>neration to money , of money to value, of value to freedom , and of freedom to order. Our formula for currency is a worthless and primitive simple which should have gone down the well when the first spring water of democracy was piped into the house. To the engineer our dollar has about the same scientific sanction as the kilowatt-hour would have, if, after an exact measurement of volts and ohms and the resulting amperes, effective value per hour could be complacently altered by a transatlantic cable message between the semi -official agents of gold -standard principalities -- and then frantically adjusted during a special session of Congress.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The problem of adequate remuneration involves chiefly the question of deferred payment-- the settling of balances after an unequal exchange of effort- and the future recompense of that extra -effort which is vital to the community . The means of accomplishing these equities have grown immensely involved</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">since they were deliberately set in reverse by autocracy, gathered up from the wreckage, still running, and utilized by democracy without suspicion . To reconstruct the essential relationship between value, or orderly freedom , and valid currency, let us go back to simpler times.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Before there were any conventional tokens of value to assist exchange, such as currency -- that is, before there was any well disciplined trust in princes, or any organized community good faith -- there was still in process, exactly as there is now , a constant exchange of current labor and goods. At that stage of economic development -- the stage of trade, or barter - it is easy to realize that the total sum of skins, flints and forest produce made up the total sum of materialized effort - or wealth and this total was itself their cumbersome currency. The power of demand was the total sum of goods not required for immediate consumption provided always that someone else desired them . This total, as today, was a product of effort, in the medium of matter - less the incalculable demands of the tax collector -- a partial product, not a factor. But the economists of those days had more excuse for loose thinking than <text:soft-page-break/>we, for they had no conception that the cost of order is a factor of value ; they had not thought about time; they had some reprehensible habits in regard to human effort - taking a slave when they could get one and they had no fixed area factor, the amount of available land being more than they could use . Being conscious of no such thing as economic order, they naturally turned their minds to alchemy and astrology . A few of them went in for discreet schism to keep occupied . These founders of the Pessimist School of Economy had dark suspicions that the Magic-man&apos;s formal factors of economic value Labor and Luck -- were prejudiced by the gratifying offerings at the altar. Nevertheless, it is obvious that one law of economics, of which we are apt to lose sight, was fully appreciated by our predecessors, namely, that the sum of total avail able negotiable goods is a perfectly satisfactory medium of exchange and measure of comparative value as long as time is ignored as an economic factor and there is no question of deferred payment. They all disregarded the factor of land in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P50">exactly the same way that we now disregard the factor of time. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P50"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P50">As political boundaries were extended till they met and stood rigid , men became more and more conscious of land – <text:span text:style-name="T30">over-conscious</text:span> of its fluctuating &quot; value&quot; and not sufficiently conscious of its unimpairable area , and it was only as these competing political boundaries drew breast to breast that this basic factor of area became available to the economist. At this point, extra -effort, being within fixed limits, could be measured and stored for future use, and the economic inducement to exercise foresight came cleanly into play, thus creating the necessity of a just basis for deferred payment, or, in other words, creating the necessity of devising a pledge of value which would be valid in time as well as area . But at this stage, when the factor of land -area might have been utilized , orderly freedom had not been dreamed of ; and they were still hampered by the Magic -man &apos;s pretended control of luck . During the confusion , the position of patriarch crystallized quietly into that of monarch , as the advantages of the control of this new and definite factor became very attractive both to the king and his family. </text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">What had happened was that the national economic system was at last politically enclosed , and the living force to be measured and utilized - human effort -- was capable of being read by a gauge. It was no longer necessary to estimate it by the length of the driver&apos;s whip : it was no longer necessary to do as we do today - harass and discourage it at every point and measure it by the intensity of its protest ; and it was certainly no longer necessary to measure it by little pieces of gold which we have to borrow at times on ruinous terms from private or alien owners.28 From that time on , the pressure of population <text:soft-page-break/>upon land-area in a given time was capable of scientifically measuring value, whether present or future. Extra effort could be exerted and stored up, and its value accurately measured in the gauge of census-area -hours. There should be no further need to guess at its value, as we do today, and subsequently suffer at frequent intervals from our over-estimates or our under-estimates. Mentally , in our economic methods, we wander aimlessly back to the meandering and unconfined headwaters of human energy and guess what the value amounts to in terms of gold , ignoring the simple scientific factors of value. </text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P66">Because volume, density and time are our only measurable factors they are just as vital to the economist as they are to the engineer, as far as value is concerned ; but we have been thrown off the track since the time of communal government when land was free and there was no effective confined pressure, and hence no means of measuring it, and , later , by the self- interest of the autocrat as he realized his dominance of effort through the control of area. So nearly omnipotent was this dominance that it was crystallized into divine-right and this was zealously taught to be a sacred institution . The means of measuring economic value were, at that stage, carefully kept out of our control and we were not invited by the king to help him in his empirical methods. Secure in his carefully fabricated divine right and knowing nothing about engineering, he tapped the economic pressure system with the aid of the royal dentist and the nearest Hebrew . When toothless Hebrews went into temporary retirement he issued alloyed tokens of royal deman<text:span text:style-name="T31">d </text:span>crowns, sovereigns, etc., which we call money -- and in this way extracted more painlessly the surplus supply created by extra-effort. This was also crystallized into divine-right, as Del Mar points out when he emphasizes the significance upon coins of the phrase &quot; Dei gratia&quot; -- by the grace of God.29 Del Mar further quotes Hallam as stating &quot; The right of debasing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the coin was also claimed by this prince ( Philip the Fair ) as a choice flower of the crown.&quot; Finding this method reasonably successful, the king might have exercised it in moderation for a long time, but owing to the queen &apos;s insatiable appetite for bread and honey, he tried it too often and the royal tokens</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">were notoriously debased . At this the king became confused and irritable, realizing that he had some responsibility as well as power . He disposed peevishly , for a consideration , of the privilege of coining arbitrary tokens of demand with which to absorb surplus effort; and , little as we may realize it, that privilege is today almost as childishly and unintelligently exercised as it was then .

At the same time, in spite of our generous validation of credit in terms of nonexistent gold , our estimate of total value, even when ex pressed as flamboyant &quot; gold &quot; bonds or asmore discreet &quot; gold &quot; currency, falls far short, under orderly government, of being a sufficient expression of our basic assets.30 It is not because we over- estimate these assets that we suffer from inflation : it is because we so under -estimate them that issue after issue of certificates of value, expressed in terms of gold , is feasible, with spasmodic interruptions, when the international holders of the world&apos;s meager gold supply bring us sharply to heel. The result is that a few grow a great deal richer and the rest of us, if not actually a little poorer , at any rate unnecessarily insecure, and indecently grateful for the few crumbs that fall from the table. And the mischief wrought is not vicious. It is aimless. Total effort is checked ; and the pitiful margin of value is badly divided. </text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P51">Just as in the days of the most simple community, when goods and services were exchangeable for goods and services, so today bills-of-lading and warehouse receipts are valid tokens of exchangeable wealth , and if we ceased all effort, would go on being so till everything was consumed . But lack ing autocratic compulsion , the vital need of democracy is extra-effort. How can we encourage this except by providing that our inducement shall be guaranteed by some token that is a negotiable subdivision of total national basic value-- not a mathematically unenforcible title to a share in a stock of gold which we do not own, or a deferred title to magnificent sums of gold , which do not exist, based on the optimism of some amateur Secretary of the Treasury , or the dubious credit, expressed in gold , of some pyramiding captain of finance, endorsed first by his own bank, next by a friendly subsidiary, and later quite innocently by the Federal Reserve Bank which , as the representative of the victims themselves, is wrestling in good faith ,</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The exertion of a useful effort in excess of present need is the first half of a transaction which can only be justly met by the return of an equally valuable service at some future time. Such a transaction should involve the transfer of a pledge of unimpairable economic value, otherwise it may well purchase much less under altered conditions, due to some sudden shift in the incidence of taxation , or to an incalculable increase in the number of tokens. Money should therefore be a pledge of effective measurable value,, which is the full flow of effort, modified by the cost of order, and its redemption in value should not only be mathematically possible, but it should be unavoidable. This can only be provided for by basing it upon measurable factors which are fully comprehensive. The community has no control over gold ,which we shamelessly boast is free, and no control of time and labor, which we also boast are free , nor of goods which ought to be free. It has proper political control of only one thing <text:s/>- land-area -- which , because it is limited, can be rationally employed as the base of an unimpair able measure. Nothing but a lien on this, as modified by population and validated by the prepayment of taxes, is a scientific guaranty of deferred payment. It will be promptly recognized by the economic student that this most essential specification for the adequate remuneration of extra -effort brings us back to one of those delightful clearings in the economic jungle , where nearly all the economists have met and shaken hands in mutual congratulation. This is a specification of what money should be a safe basis for deferred payment but not, unfortunately, of what it is. What it is today nobody really knows. It appears to be an apologetic certification of a fraction of national value, governed positively by the amount of gold that international bullion -dealers find it convenient to leave within our boundaries, or advantageous to withdraw .<text:span text:style-name="T31">31</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P66">Both the institutions of irresponsible autocracy and embryonic democracy have tended to cover up the most essential function of money -- its integrity as a fractional pledge of full value, so that it can be used as a safe basis for deferred payment-- and it was necessary to clear away the overhanging branches of these phases of government to realize what money is in its simplest terms. That our short-cut lands us side by side with the more painstaking political-economists, is a matter for renewed congratulations, if they will permit.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Gide, characteristically, even while acquiescing in metallic currency, touches a significant flaw in our present unit, without realizing that the discovery of an obvious flaw in the logic of a science is quite as valuable a service as the discovery of a law . He is very clear-sighted when examining isolated phenomena, but appears to rest his case with a statement of contradictory evidence. He proceeds as follows: &quot; However , it is right to recognize that though the precious metals are far better suited by their natural properties to serve as instruments of exchange than as a measure of values, yet they possess two</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">special properties which enable them to fulfill this second func<text:span text:style-name="T31">tion in a manner which if not perfect, is at least superior to the</text:span> use of any other imaginable measure of value. These two properties are firstly their very great facility of transport, secondly , their almost indefinite durability. Thanks to the first of these two properties, the value of the precious metals is, of all values, that which fluctuates least from place to place. Thanks to the second, that which fluctuates least from year to year. It is this double invariability (relatively speaking ) in space and in time which is the essential condition of every common measure.&quot; He sees plainly , at this stage, what is required, but a little later lays his finger on what we suffer owing to the fact that even these inadequate qualifications are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not met, when he goes on to say, &quot; If, then , the value of the precious metals offers substantial enough guaranties of stability in time when short periods only are under consideration , it altogether fails in this respect when long periods of time are included , say twenty - or twenty -five years, not to speak of several centuries. In this regard, then , our proposed measure of value is extremely defective.&quot; 32 The amazing misconception here is the claim that facility of transport and physical durability have any relation to scientific value. One might as well contend that a column of gold is the best indicator for a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P51">thermometer owing to the ease with which it can be moved from the North Pole to the mouth of a volcano and to its &quot; stability.&quot; He is confusing physical characteristics with economic value, which is much like measuring a man &apos;s virtue by the size of his diamond . </text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P51">One of the earliest practical utilizations of the phenomena of arbitrary currency was made by Gresham ; and his so -called &quot; law ,&quot; as formulated by McLeod, is that in every country where two legal moneys are in circulation , the bad money drives out the good . This has attracted attention mainly because it is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">stated as a paradox. But if stated in other terms it has greater significance, even though it has less charm . If money is conceded to be the power to command effort, guaranteed by government, it is obvious that if there are two tokens with equal arbitrary power of demand but different commercial value, the one of less commercial value will be employed within its own domain to obtain services, and the one of greater commercial value will be employed outside the boundaries of that domain ,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">where arbitrary domestic mandates are not honored. What Gresham actually laid down was an equally important law – namely that there can be no uniform measure of economic value under political conditions which are fundamentally dif<text:span text:style-name="T31">ferent.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Now let us brush away all political cobwebs for a moment and look at national currency from some point of view which is not that of so -called conventional political-economy, keeping in mind the qualifications upon which the thoughtful econo mists have happily agreed, namely, that a valid currency should have the immediate function of serving as a measure of value and a medium of exchange, and a continuing function of serving as a safe basis for delayed exchange , or deferred payment. This elaborate definition of a unit of value would be regarded as pathetic in any but an economic treatise . Our ritualists demand a scientific unit of value-- and stipulate solemnly that it shall not only be a unit of value now : it shall also be a unit of value over-page ; and it shall remain a unit of value if they chance to take a nap. And having thus ponderously admonished their irresponsible unit and fallen asleep, we later observe them in frenzied pursuit of this unit like terriers on the trail of a departed rabbit which some hours previously had insouciantly selected a breakfast from Dr. Royal Meeker&apos;s 33 list of nourishing commodities. Up hill and down dale, they follow vainly ; and if we chart their zealous activities we get a typical Index-number &quot; curve&quot; - probably the most solemn farce ever perpetrated in the name of science in connection with a unit of value.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">With fixed political boundaries defining the hourly effort of population within a region of self-imposed order , we are in a precise area of potential value, normally increasing because of our unquenchable desire for ampler freedom . To devise for use within this area a token of value, capable of maintaining its relative integrity at all times, and at all points, this token must necessarily be expressed in the same terms as the total basic value of the area in which it is to function , which is calculably modified from year to year, <text:span text:style-name="T18">not only by population -density but also by the cost of what, from year to year, we conceive to be order.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P66">Looking at the problem from a slightly different angle, let us imagine we are required to establish a measure capable, at all times and under all conditions, of maintaining its relative integrity within an orderly area of fixed dimensions and varying pressure. The statement of the problem defines the only possible solution ; for since our measure has to express the value of pressure upon area, each of these components of value, together with the cost of maintaining the integrity of this area , must be represented in its composition. The effective value expressed by this &quot; measure of value&quot; can only be determined further in terms of units of time.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Taking a simple scientific parallel, if we desire to express the potential value of a confined force we do it often in terms of pounds pressure per square feet. If we further desire to express the effective value of this force in motion we employ the factor of time and state it as so many foot-pound-seconds, which is simply an expression of pressure per square foot, less the cost of making this potential pressure effective, measured in terms of the mass and rotation of the earth our ultimate unimpairable dimensions. It would be useless to attempt to measure the value of this force by a definite weight of wheat, lard, cotton , corn , silver or gold , no matter how highly we held</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52">them in esteem . </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52">Within an area such as the United States, if we care to be guided by scientific procedure, we must employ for the measurement of economic value, instead of ounces of gold , or very doubtful titles to ounces of gold , a definite unit based upon census-area . If, because of economic order and security, the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reactions of effort are quickened, neither our unit nor accumulated capital will be adversely affected. The basic unit remains the same, but it measures a greater flow of effective effort; and should logically command at least the same quantity of goods and services of others, instead of less , as does our present unit. This symptom of a unit of value commanding less as activity increases should have absolutely established its scientific in validity if most of us had not been too busy to think about the matter.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52">If we employed such a unit, we would , at any rate, rise or fall together nationally , instead of maintaining as we do now a continual fratricidal economic war within our boundaries. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52">The political- economists, wrestling with disconcerting political arbitraries, saw money in its relation to a limited supply of gold which because of its original scarcity, acted as a check to irresponsible action , or they think of it in relation to goods, the wasting product of effort, or to manual labor, the least valuable form of effort. The curious aspect of their endeavors, from a scientific point of view , is that while they have struggled vainly to determine the total volume of national value in terms of an indeterminable unit of value, it apparently has not occurred to them that their unit might be determined by the total sum of national value.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">As suggested vaguely by others, Professor Irving Fisher, with all the painstaking method of the scientist, proposes as a remedial adjustment to employ the fluctuating demand for commodities as a basis of value. Now if it were possible to hold taxation and rent under scrutiny, to gauge accurately the value of physical and mental labor, and to fully disclose the total available quantity of goods desired, then, with calculable taxation and with rents, wages and professional fees controlled</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">by law , the retail price of finished commodities might be a fair index of the whole population &apos;s informed demand. Such intelligent demand would undoubtedly be a clew to value. His method assumes a vague relationship between uninformed demand and unknown supply ; but since the demand may be thwarted and the supply suddenly contracted or expanded, the relationship he proposes to use is at the best a measure of material value, vitiated by several unknown factors. Only (or measurable flow , which is the same thing ) can be employed to determine economic value, and if we a<text:span text:style-name="T33">r</text:span>e to measure supply or demand, or the consequent flow , we must have some thing comprehensive to measure them <text:soft-page-break/>with . Fisher makes an ingenious attempt to measure one vitalfactor - population - by its grosser appetites. Why not measure population directly ? The many subtle forms of rent, the <text:span text:style-name="T33">still more subtle values of mental effort, and the intervention </text:span>of erratic taxation, are impossible to measure.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Even if this method is attempted there is no accurate index of the retail price of finished commodities, such as cakes, shoes , clothes and sausages, and the services of the retailer which go with them .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">What we can call to our assistance , in calculating population by Fisher &apos;s method, is an estimate of the absorbing power of rent : an optimistic or pessimistic approximation of the time the incidence of taxation ; and finally the index numbers of those unfinished commodities which lie behind the cake, the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52">shoes, the clothes and the sausages, namely , wheat, hides, wool and hogs. But the index numbers of these commodities, useful as they may be, are simply industry&apos;s guess at the total quantity of these goods and the probable future appetite of the population, measured in terms of a fluctuating unit. To use the product of an estimate, an approximation , a surmise and a compound forward guess, and record its belated consequences by a fluctuating weight of gold , is intensely interesting, but it is not scientific. To comment seriously on this plan calls for the same patience that the engineer must exercise when some enthusiast proposes to measure steam pressure by weighing the water and the coal which are needed for the boiler, keeping cheerful tally by dropping washers into a bucket. The enthusiast would be firmly led to the front of the boiler where there was a pressure gauge. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52">Yet Fisher has done enormous service in laying bare the practical defects of our currency, and may be wiser than he seems. His project has two merits : it seeks to approximate population justly by its physical appetites and it makes a gentle concession to those who think there is some sanctity in gold . Poor Galileo was not so tactful, and he had a much harder time of it.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">We are wise to respect prejudice if we desire to accomplish anything ; and there are still very capable engineers who pretend to express the value of expanding gas against the walls of a cylinder in terms of horsepower, though the noble horse has been long since discarded.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Putting aside all other features of Fisher&apos;s plan, it must fail to obtain the sanction of the scientist because it employs one product to measure some other products - all of which are partial and secondary material values modified by many factors of uncertainty.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52">Gold cannot be a measure of value for the same basic reasons. It is a partial product of effort and neither supply nor demand is measurable. Gold , in the past, has never been anything but a measure of distrust and uncertainty ; and, while it was limited in quantity , a check upon arbitrary manipulation. It has no interior place in a democracy, except in the arts. Between international traders it will probably continue to be used as long as confidence is lacking and something less bulky and more valuable is not found. As a matter of fact, the commercial value of gold is probably far above the artificial price which we maintain politically to the detriment of the producers who exercise nothing of its tremendous value of domination when massed in a few competent hands which are strengthened by deep-rooted delusion, and backed up by armies and navies whenever the solemn farce turns to tragedy. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52">Gide deals further with the difficult problem of money as follows: &quot; Every coin should be looked on as an order drawn on the sum total of existing wealth , giving the bearer a claim on some portion or other of that wealth , up to the value marked on his coin .&quot; 34 If &quot;wealth &quot; is largely defined, this is a very</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">significant specification of money ; and, per contra, a very concise indictment of our so -called &quot; gold &quot; dollar.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P52"><text:soft-page-break/>Money should be a fractional pledge of value-- not a thing , expressed , like every other scientific unit of measurement, in terms of total value; no matter how that total may be modi fied by its swaying components. The return we are concerned with is not the &quot; intrinsic&quot; quality of the money, nor the &quot; value&quot; marked upon it, nor yet a fixed portion of the sum total of existing goods; but we are concerned with the indisputable</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P81">right to demand service equally effective under accumulating pressure as that which we rendered. If we sell our effort for one dollar , and receive a dollar which , owing to altered conditions, will only give the right to demand half the effort in a year &apos;s time, what satisfaction or inducement is offered by the denomination of the coin ? </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53">If in disgust we ceased all extra-effort, exchange of goods might still go on busily for a few years ; but when the surplus was consumed, we would be back at the commencement of economic history, with this essential difference : there would be no possibility of making an exodus in search of free land.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The hungry landlord would then look over the fence at the hungry laborer ; and, if they were not yet in a mood to negotiate , the landlord would probably go back to his search for volunteer potatoes, where the parings had been thrown out in his days of affluence. Realizing that it was also advisable to get some new planting done, with a reborn instinct for a reserve, he would request the laborer to help . The laborer would ask what the remuneration was to be, and the landlord, having no reserve to draw on , would be compelled to get down to fundamentals. He would in any case , to keep his helper going,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have to share a part of his precious volunteer potatoes ; but the laborer, also awakened to the need of a reserve, would ask more. If the landlord promised a later day&apos;s work to the laborer, he would be laughed at, having never enjoyed any reputation as a physical worker. In the end , the only adequate</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">protection the landlord could offer would be a lien on a portion of the land. The promise of future potatoes would not be acceptable since the sophisticated laborer faces a double dilemma. If the crop fails, he does not get his pay ; if it is unduly heavy, a stipulated quantity of potatoes will not enable</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">him to command an equal amount of service from his fellows when he needs it. He realizes that the one thing which will neither expand nor contract with disconcerting consequences is his neighbor&apos;s acre and with a fractional lien on this as security , provided taxes are prepaid by the owner, he can always look for his labor to be redeemed . With such security he is not only willing to work , but to work long and hard, so that the joint surplus indispensable to orderly community life is again in a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">way to be built up. If a dispute arose , as it probably would , in regard to the actual area of the fraction pledged, it might be necessary to call in an engineer as arbitrator. He would advise that to protect them both this area should vary with the population of the district, since the greater the population the smaller would need to be the area, and the smaller the population the greater would need to be the area. If this simple statement of the determination of compound value by the employment of essential reciprocal factors were too much for them they would have to take his word for it or go back to their</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Now let us assemble the propositions which have been put</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53">forward in common terms. The sequence is as follows: </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53">1. <text:span text:style-name="T18">That land-area, population and time, in a region of self imposed order, are the basic factors, or limits, of economic value.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">2 . <text:span text:style-name="T18">That under democracy human effort has been freed from arbitrary control.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53">3 . <text:span text:style-name="T18">That free human effort varies according to population.</text:span> </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53">4 . <text:span text:style-name="T18">That the factor of time does not vary.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">5 . <text:span text:style-name="T18">That within fixed political boundaries land -area does not vary.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">6 . <text:span text:style-name="T18">That control of land -area , if permitted politically, is therefore basic economic power, giving control of effort per hour, and consequently of total value.</text:span></text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">7. <text:span text:style-name="T18">That power and responsibility are complementary .</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53">8 . <text:span text:style-name="T18">That the economic responsibility of economic power (or control of value ) is taxation . </text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53"><text:span text:style-name="T35">9 .</text:span><text:span text:style-name="T18"> That just taxation must therefore rest upon the same basis as the control of value, namely, land-area , population and time.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53">10 . <text:span text:style-name="T18">That under democracy effective effort is directly proportional to inducement.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53">11. <text:span text:style-name="T18">That the tokens of value, put forward as inducement should then be incapable of partial repudiation , or debasement.</text:span></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">12. That the tokens of value, or currency, must therefore bear &apos;an integral relationship to total basic value, and can only be finally determined by the product of the same three factors land-area , population and time- as modified by the cost of order.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53">A dynamic 38 theory of economics may now be assembled as follows : </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53">The normal human effort toward ampler freedom , being a constant expression of energy in the medium of matter, the value arising from this effort can only be stated mathematically in ter<text:span text:style-name="T34">m</text:span>s of population , area and time. Whether conceived as freedom to move, or as a flow and counter -flow of effort induced by the certified right to command , at any time, relatively equal effort in return for effort expended , effective economic value can only be measured in a definite region of equilibrium , or self-imposed order, in which the pro rata responsibility for the cost of this order has been definitely apportioned with relation to population , area and time.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53">If effort, and the resistance of the area in which it is exerted , are stated in comprehensive measurable terms,- population , area and time, - a mathematical resultant is obtainable </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P53">30 The word dynamic is employed in preference to kinetic. It has, for one thing, a deeper -sunk niche in our comprehension . In modern scientific terminology the word dynamic includes both statics and kinetics ; and we shall have to consider both in economics since we have money and interest, wealth and income, potential effort and effective effort. The word dynamic should also be employed as a tribute to Jevons, the English mathematician and economist, who would undoubtedly have amplified his dynamic conception of economics if he had enjoyed the advantage of being involved in the apparent chaos and the tremendous potentialities of democracy.</text:p>

This resultant, which is the occupancy-value of national area, may be regarded as national economic unity, and can then be employed as a scientific measure of value, any fractional part of which will remain relatively constant in area and time.37</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It is perhaps almost too much to hope that this theory will be immediately self-evident: our minds are dulled by very respectable delusion : our affairs at present are in no way ordered in conformity with it ; and the difficulty of making any change in a convention without injuring the individual acts as a bar</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to mental readjustment. There is , however, this to work upon : Our present conception of value, our present methods of taxation and our present international basis for national currency, are all so archaic and arbitrary that they are not giving very great satisfaction . Any proposed alteration in either currency or taxation arouses the protests of those who are fortunately able at the moment &quot; to let well-enough alone.&quot; There is, how ever , some hope held out in this theory which is not offered separately by either the tax -specialist or the currency-specialist : if we make taxation directly proportional to the control of basic value and stop there, we could anticipate a perfectly proper protest from those who have exchanged their labor for this control of value in good faith and are afraid of some disastrous shift ; if we make currency directly representative of basic value and stop there, we could anticipate an equally vigorous protest from our discreet international overlords who almost unconsciously manipulate our present so -called values to their own advantage, and also from those who might</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54">fear even more rapid debasement than we now suffer of a currency for which they have exchanged their labor in good </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P54">* Time, as a factor, disappears in the actual measure or token of value</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for the reason that value = effort X time</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">resistance X time</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">-</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">-. resistance</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">.But in any specific measurement of effective value it reappears, as in taxation which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">measures the time- value of order : interest which measures the time-value of money, or certified freedom : wages, which measure the time-value of purchased effort ; and rent, which measures the time- value of land -area .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P66">faith ; but if we recognize simultaneously the good faith of the citizen landholder and the citizen bank-depositor, and take both steps at the same time, so that the moment the responsibility was imposed upon the control of value, that value became fully disclosed and a final basis of currency, we might find that the protest would diminish . For those other citizens who had never looked forward to the exercise of domination without contingent responsibility, and who had not unduly exerted their effort for a currency that could halve its value in a few years, there would be the encouragement of having the responsibility at present, and of remuneration being integrally related to basic economic value, so that it might be always capable of standing up against increasing pressure, and worth saving for future use , instead of being found debased or spurious at some critical juncture. The practical application of the theory woul<text:span text:style-name="T36">d </text:span>mean simply this : to the owner of land area, we would say : &quot; If we are prepared to throw off nationally the debased tradition of a gold -standard of value, you will then hold control of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">value. This we recognize as the proper reward of your past effort. We shall measure this in terms of total basic value so that you may be held responsible, but such measurement will have nothing to do with special values due to past effort, neither will it be a prejudiced personal guess : it will simply be the local census-area value of your land ; and in certifying this value we shall also see that it becomes immediately the effective basis of currency.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">To the man who holds our present currency like a kite in a gusty wind, we would say : &quot; You now hold negotiable tokens of fluctuating value ; we shall honor these by exchanging them for a pledge of unimpairable basic value.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">To the man who held neither control of basic value nor fluctuating &quot; value&quot; in the form of our present currency, we would say , &quot; You are no longer to be taxed for effort or need, and for your surplus effort you shall have a pledge of under lying economic value which cannot be repudiated or debased .&quot;</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P55"><text:soft-page-break/>basic value, which we call currency, bears no integral relation to that value. Our tokens are subject to disastrous fluctuations which appear uncontrollable owing to the intervention of an alien and arbitrary factor; while taxation is imposed, not primarily in proportion to the logical control of value through land -ownership , but subsequently on the vulnerable flanks of effort - need and activity - thus debasing our tokens still further .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55">It is not democracy that is to blame for this ; democracy is the logical outcome of our belated decision to divide political power equally -- a saving step from insecurity to firm ground. The cause of our confusion is that, so far, under democracy we have devised no scientific means of measuring anything</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">exactly , and have dealt with actual or economic power only as it crowded us into a corner. We have not realized that taxation, interest and ground-rent are calculably related to total national economic value, if we can only lay down the foundations of just measurement by devising an unimpairable unit.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55">Land-area , population and time-- these are the only measurable components of value ; and either soon through quickening perception , or later through intolerable friction, we shall come to employ them for the foundation of economic science, for the determination of basic national value and for the construction of an unimpairable measure of value. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55">The net occupancy-value of national area , in a given time, this is the only index of basic value. Taxation, the hourly responsibility for the maintenance of order -- a pre-requisite of value-- and currency, a token and pledge of that value expressed in similar terms- these must be measured by the same gauge if we are to compass freedom . </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P55">The continuous effort toward freedom , in a measurable region of order -- this is the vital thing to comprehend. The physical character of the area in which this effort is exerted and the thin layers of old time and labor are no more important, as far as measurement is concerned, than the paint and varnish on a pressure gauge.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">GOLD, OUR FACTOR OF HAVOC</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P56">THERE is only one rational defense of the gold standard ; but this its advocates repudiate , employing it solely as an epithet to be flung at certain other means of measurement. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P56"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P56">If by legislation , or what they scornfully call &quot; fiat,&quot; the quantity of gold within the country were fixed and an inventory of our wealth taken at the same time, we would then have two known quantities, and could scientifically express a fractional part of one in terms of a fractional part of the other. For one glorious moment we would have a gold standard which mathematically measured visible value in terms of ounces of gold . But to maintain this ratio inventors, poets, preachers and scientists would have to be kept under lock and key like lunatics for fear they might make some unauthorized contribution to value and thus upset the legal ratio . Gold also would have to be put under lock and key and made a government monopoly, so that with each increase in visible value, which was properly authenticated by a suitable bureau, more gold could be mined under strict government supervision : the export of gold would also have to be controlled ; and in this way, by infinite care and adjustment we might maintain a rude measure of what we now call &quot; value.&quot; But we would promptly invite smuggling, boot legging and moonshining -- the painful reactions due to an effort to ensure virtue by fiat. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P56"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P56">The opposition to fiat is very sound ; but only by fiat or legislation can gold conceivably be justified as a basis of measurement. Fiat money is as objectionable as the gold standardist contends; but political discretion , such as we now employ, is still worse from a scientific point of view . What we require for the measurement of value are measurable and ultimate factors. Scientific value, as shown more fully later 1</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P82">cannot be determined by product or output which on one hand may be diminished by friction and on the other hand may be amplified by postponement: it can only be scientifically determined by <text:span text:style-name="T37">measurable</text:span> potentialities after taking into consideration the cost of providing order and facilities.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P56"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P56">Partly because of its general desirability and its physical integrity , but chiefly because of its scarcity, which at the beginning of its use almost amounted to a definite limitation of quantity ( an essential element in a measure of value ), gold , in the days of arbitrary political power, came to be regarded as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P56">the most dependable check upon the undue exercise of individuality in those distressing moments when divine right was noticeably out of touch with divine guidance. Gold , in fact, became a token of value much more durable than the King&apos;s favor ; and the dour money-lender of that period tried very hard to impress this truth on such of his children as had social aspirations. As for the merchant, the right to call on gold in Amsterdam far outweighed the slowly -moving aid of an ambassador, and was even more potent than the obstructive potentate with whom he had to reckon . Economically, in that golden age when divine rightwas so calmly misappropriated by mortal men , gold was king of kings, lord of lords and the only ruler of princes. It is no wonder, then , that it was worshipped. It was omnipotent. It is scarcely a cause for wonder that this element of worship, so long ingrained, still lingers in democ racy, even though we are quite sure that we have got rid of the personal devils it so capably checked . The real cause for wonder is that we now worship the shadow and not the substance . That this form of worship still lingers may be readily learned by making, in certain conservative circles, a good natured query in regard to the scientific validity of the gold standard. One is rebuked, not for curiosity but for irreverence. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P56"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P56">The substance and body of gold , then -- not its image, as to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">day - was rightly regarded as the least impairable reward of effort, and was accepted as a measure of value because it was a most effective measure of individual freedom - freedom to move, freedom to act, and freedom to choose -- and this is</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">THE ECONOMICS OF FREEDOM</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57">Note, Diagram B </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57">If gold remains &quot; free&quot; then it is unmeasurable, and a measure of value that is unmeasurable has no use as a means of measurement. It would be just as rational to employ goats for milestones, first stipulating solemnly that they must be &quot; free.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Gold is simply one of many useful commodities, subject to private production ; and it should not be necessary to point out that a dimension which may be increased at will has no relation to measurable value.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">If economic value is not the assurance of freedom it is not worth bothering about. If freedom is in any way linked to a privately produced, or privately reduced, commodity, it is not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57">worth striving for. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57">If economics is a science, and is concerned with the measurement of economic value, then it must put forward some indisputable unit of value. If this unit is to be comprehensive it must deal with the measurable limits of freedom -- and we should be devoutly thankful that these are remote. If our token of value ( or freedom ) can be based on a commodity capable of being carried in a vest pocket we shall find that our freedom can be handled in the same way. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P57">If, during any given time, and in any given area, Effort, the cause of value, Order, the pre-requisite of value, and Freedom , the essence of value, are in any way ultimately limited by population , area and time, and our conception of national order, then these factors must be represented in our unit of measurement - unless the most elementary principles of every other science are ignored.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P83">exactly what a scientific measure of value must still be today a measure of freedom , not freedom X <text:span text:style-name="T38">(100/243)</text:span> ? It also, as the economists properly contend, must be redeemable -- but in freedom , which is possible, not in gold , which is mathematically impossible. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58">We know this : our official conception of money, our measure of value and medium of exchange the inducement of effort and the key to freedom - still takes its bearings from the gold standard , whether the angle of departure is 30, 40 or 80 degrees. In economics, the science responsible for the measure ment of liberated human effort, we still hold religiously to gold as the only tangible token of value, quite unconcerned by the fact that it bears no relation to this effort, or to the time and area that define it. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58">As a matter of fact all our economic tradition is international, and being international is necessarily more political than scientific . If value is in any way due to order, and if national conceptions of order vary, a unit of value that has international scope and can traverse different mediums at the same velocity must possess some remarkable inherent qualities. If such a thing exists it is well worthy of our worship . But it does not exist. It is sheer delusion . We might just as well take an alarm -clock to Mars to get us up in time for sunrise.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Internationally, the best we have in gold today is an emasculated arbitrary exiled in the United States ; and it is emasculated not only because men are blindly striving toward a larger and juster conception of value and freedom through such schemes as the Federal Reserve System , the minimum wage, single -tax and Professor Irving Fisher&apos;s commodity unit, but because the one almost royal quality of gold has been impaired by the cyanide process, by tube-milling, by dredging and by multitudinous spurious tokens which pretend to represent it. Safely housed in New York and badly shaken , it still petulantly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">asserts to solemn regents ( who couch these irrational demands in royal form ) , its right to dominate economic value- and the human effort and freedom so disastrously involved.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P66">If in the checkered area of international arbitraries gold is still essential owing to lack of a common code of order, let us admit it, deplore it -- and use it, but let us use it frankly as God-fearing brass-founders use their buddhas-- as articles of barter because they are highly desired merchandise of small</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bulk , &apos;not because they are capable of breaking a drought or healing sickness.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The present utterances of the international controllers of massed gold and their many conventional-minded supporters , when not actually disingenuous, have a delicate flavor of na ivetÈ which it is almost painful to question .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58">No one can deny that we have enormously increased our certificates of value , whether they are obligations &quot; payable in gold &quot; on demand, which we call currency, or deferred obligations also &quot; payable in gold &quot; which we call bonds. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58">10,093,275,393 3 of these so -called gold dollars are owing to us by foreign debtors. It is suggested, not so much in the name of charity, but for the sake of re<text:span text:style-name="T38">e</text:span>stablishing the international domination of gold that we cancel these obligations. As a contribution to the cause of what we were told was &quot; freedom ,&quot; or for the sake of charity , it would be a magnificent act, but it would also be a magnificent piece of folly unless certain important considerations are faced frankly . While these debts may be generously cancelled we have unfortunately endorsed and negotiated the corresponding obligations. They are still in the system and must be redeemed by the payment of over 1,650 tons of privately -owned gold , which is obviously not available except upon very onerous terms-- if the law of supply and demand still holds good !</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The first precaution , then, would be a clear- cut and acceptable program for raising this sum from our own citizens by taxation . Perhaps some of the advocates of cancellation will suggest a sales-tax, thus fastening this burden as nearly as possible on the wage-earner in proportion to his need ! The second consideration, which must appear very cold blooded when such a generous gift is under contemplation , is the equity which can only be met by an undertaking from our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&apos;See page 124.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P83">debtors that the new territory acquired by them during the days of their borrowing will not be effectively closed to us by tariffs and prior concessions. Otherwise, the United States taxpayer provides for the fences and the gamekeeper , and the alien imperialist enjoys the hunting. This situation is perhaps a delicate one since in the name of &quot; freedom &quot; we have already pre<text:span text:style-name="T38">e</text:span>mpted some preserves of our own. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P58">The third sophisticated consideration is whether with their obligations to the United States taxpayer generously cancelled , our foreign debtors are not promptly going to be encouraged to incur new private obligations to less sentimental money lenders in exchange for the huge stock of gold now resting idly in United States Government vaults, to the embarrassment of its international owners, thus serving a double end by putting it to very profitable exterior use and assisting &quot; de flation&quot; at home ,4 incidentally redoubling the taxpayers&apos; burden .&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">To leave in our domestic system certificates of value to the extent of $ 10, 093,275 ,393, and then waive our call on the so -called value itself, is painful enough to contemplate, since this would dilute the value of every dollar now in the savings banks; but to open the way to the profitable export of our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">focus of value is much more painful to most of us, though not necessarily to its private owners. However, it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good, even under a system that bases &quot; value&quot; and the individual freedom so obviously involved , upon a small and active pea to be found , at times, under one of many shells .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">If we have the courage to base taxation upon the control of value instead of upon need and activity , and then claim our full heritage of the measurable value which results, we could afford</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to be generous and cancel all indebtedness. ( And we could also afford to remind our debtors that we were under the impression that the World War was being fought for freedom</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not for Mandate C .)</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Because we do not recognize and lay claim to our full</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P66">heritage of national value and because we still place the burden of taxation on the needy and the active our hands are tied . Effort is potential value: freedom is accomplished value, and because we continue to attempt to express these two phases of value, within our boundaries in terms of ounces of gold we still live in a state of continual bondage and revolt. Our liberty is checked today as much as it ever was by the linking of abstract patriotism with allegiance to a mad monarch .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P59">The tradition that economic value can be measured by gold has many of the aspects of a mental disease ; for we worship our self-created arbitrary, and from the mouths of its high priests we hear solemn and unctuous statements that we fail, through very familiarity, to protest against as vicious. We still hold to a debased belief to which we sacrifice our worn-out workers and their children even while we send missionaries to the Far East. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P59"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P59">We are so used to the ritual that even now it may be stated and awake no response but approval. Here is a specimen homily delivered by a banker .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot; In the present chaotic condition of economics and finance we have at least one solid fact to tie to , and that is that th<text:span text:style-name="T39">e </text:span>dollar has 25.8 grains of gold .&quot; Comment is not necessary.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P59">Here is another , a statement published with approval by a leading financial journal. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P59"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P59">&quot; The world is sick, awfully sick . We do not expect it to recover until it discards the quack doctors that are now treating it. Instead of stimulants such as inconvertible paper money, high tariffs, income and other taxes, subsidies, bounties, bonuses and doles, it needs a plain diet of simple foods, of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P59">balanced budgets and of stable exchange.&quot; (<text:span text:style-name="T18">So far so good, if the simple food is not only for simple people.</text:span> ) &quot; For its monetary troubles it should take the gold cure instead of the paper cure.&quot; (<text:span text:style-name="T18">We are sick, awfully sick , and the remedy suggested is to take a further dose of what poisoned us.</text:span>) </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P59"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P59">The tradition of a fixed economic value for gold is so strong that it colors much argument. One more liturgical statement will be cited which is extracted from the editorial of a commercial daily paper :</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P59">&quot; People must live on goods. In order to do so goods must be produced. To get them produced they must be paid for with <text:span text:style-name="T18">real</text:span> and <text:span text:style-name="T18">substantial</text:span> pay. To pay for goods with money requires that the money should have a <text:span text:style-name="T18">fixed value</text:span>. To have that value it must represent <text:span text:style-name="T18">something</text:span> which people will ex change for goods.&quot; The italics are inserted by the writer . This whole statement reeks with innocent superstition . Ou<text:span text:style-name="T39">r </text:span>gold obligations, whether prompt or deferred , are not real or substantial: they rest on political discretion . They have not a fixed value and do not mathematically represent something. Even if they were backed entirely by gold we would be no better off for this has no fixed economic value : it would still have a fixed physical value - density , malleability , color and durability -- and practically no economic value! </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P59"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P59">The uses of gold are obvious enough . Wherever there is distrust and disorder and the possibility of arbitrary political action , some article of highly concentrated commercial value will be required to settle balances. It is possible that the ritualist will find himself in agreement with this assertion ;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but it does not say much for his conception of democracy.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The havoc worked by the use of gold as a basis of value, within an area where the potential volume of effort is as great as that of the United States, is due largely to real or artificial</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">scarcity . From a small focal area it is projected over a billion acres, and a slight variation of quantity at the centre results in alarming distortions of the far flung image. It is not only insufficient in quantity for <text:soft-page-break/>the purposes of trade, but it is insufficiently controlled and at times poorly projected into space. It is either desperately wanted, or not wanted at all. It has, however, great commercial value as an international medium of exchange and for use in the arts ; and it is probable that its free market value today would be far greater than the official price. Platinum which enters an open market, and is a poor competitor of gold in the decorative arts, has risen far above its normal parity with gold . Quite apart from its politically -diminished purchasing power in foreign markets from which , owing to tariff-barriers, it returns with a hal<text:span text:style-name="T39">f </text:span>filled basket, gold is inadequately paid for today at home in terms of goods and services. The guileless gold -miner sends his bullion to the mint, and in due time it passes from the mint to some bank and, finally , to those few who are powerful enough to deal with it in mass. It is much like the control of an accumulation of water. Ten million men may each hold wells a bucketful which they have drawn painfully from and springs. They are conscious of its momentary worth , but not of its potential power. If all these small holdings of water, amounting, in the aggregate, to fifty million gallons, are carried painfully up hill and placed in one insecure reservoir, controlled by a few , we face a potential menace, and are relying upon the discretion of those few .</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P60">It is difficult to interpret the paragraph quoted in view of its context. It is put forward in a general defense of the gold standard , which is stated as follows: </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P60"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P60">&quot;Moreover, as we have seen , the most effective way, and the only practical way, of maintaining a paper currency in conformity with the standard is by making it redeemable in the standard , or, in other words, by making them interchangeable . This should be kept in mind as the reason why provisions for redemption are necessary.&quot; If we assemble these proposals we find :</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">(a ) That a valid currency must be redeemable in gold .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P60">(b ) That if this is insisted on we may get a panic. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P60">(c ) That if we get a panic , gold -- &quot; the standard of value&quot; - must be purchased abroad at great sacrifice of real values. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P60">(d ) That the only way to prevent this is to permit the Government &quot; through some organization &quot; to issue currency based on credit - not on gold . It would seem , therefore, fair to ask whether our currency is now based on gold or political discretion .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P66">The whole complication arises from the fact that the so called &quot; value&quot; measured by gold is still arbitrary. It is political: not economic. If the world had a common conception of order and freedom , we could then , to great advantage, employ a common standard of value ; for as far as the science of economics is concerned boundaries are not conventions to be respected but destroyed. Politically, until freedom and self-imposed order are general, boundaries are essential. Internationally we are not ready for free flow . With our varying conceptions of economic order we might just as well run a 100,000 volt current through our Christmas tree illuminations, as throw all the different international pressure systems into one, at this time. Gold will probably serve for many years to come as a transformer and conductor of international energy.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">If we put our own house in order in economic terms, we shall still require gold for international trade. Instead of making two calculations as we do today, converting British pounds into terms of bullion and bullion into terms of American dollars, we shall deal frankly in bullion. An American merchant would cable London for a price on tin . He would be told it was 20 oz. of gold per ton . He would telephone his bank, and instead of asking for the exchange rate he would ask the forward price of gold . On the parity of other commodity prices he might well be told that it was $ 40 per ounce , and he would thus know that his tin would cost him $ 800 per ton. This, in effect, is what we do today, but less simply .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P61">It is very probable that there was no more than sufficient gold in international circulation before the war than was needed for trade. If there had been enough the business of the inter national bullion-dealer would have had insufficient excitement to hold some of the great men who enjoy it. It is only necessary to study the illuminating comparative charts prepared by Professor Irving Fisher to realize that the dominance of gold was international.11 The same paradoxical symptom of periodic &quot; over- production &quot; was in evidence in a still underfed </text:p>

In both cases there is a specific foreign</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">element to be looked for, alien to order.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It may be deplored by some that in international exchanges such an arbitrary medium as gold has to be employed. However, it seems likely that it will fall into disuse as international good faith and order are established . At the present time we neither exercise nor look for good faith . We may buy copra in New Guinea, which has recently come under the domination of that advanced democracy , Australia , and find that an export tax has suddenly been imposed , or that we may not carry it in our American vessel from Port Moresby to Sydney, since that (because of the world war for freedom ) , has suddenly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">been made &quot; coastwise &quot; - and this is a leaf out of our own book ! The Australian may sell his wool at a price delivered New York, duty paid , and find that in the interval we have raised the duty. We are not yet ready to treat our foreign neighbors as sister states, whether wisely or unwisely may be fairly argued . Our transactions are guarded and owing to the occasional necessity of a quick get-away, our international medium of exchange must be tangible and portable, even though we can avoid the delusion that it has an unchangeable value.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62">As things stand now we are all aware that the United States has too much gold and the rest of the world not enough . As stated elsewhere,12 there was probably insufficient to go round before the dislocation of war. In a fight that was opened nobly in the name of Freedom our allies went down into the pit ; and for awhile, in their desperate extremity, we fed and clothed them . Finally we went down to help them . Between us all the menace to the world &apos;s freedom was stamped out : but we not only left them in the pit, we very reluctantly came home with the ladder, their means of exit ; for many of these countries are far more dependent upon international communications</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot; See page 314.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P85">than are we, who now aimlessly hold, as a pledge, the one accepted medium of communication.18 </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62">The domination of gold , both nationally and internationally, is due to tradition, political disorder and lack of faith , and results in sudden unforeseen economic disenfranchisement. It is a negative, a restrictive, power. In spite of repeated disasters we still permit measurement of value by arbitrary check</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62">instead of flow -- and it is not always our own citizens who decide upon the periodic days of atonement for over-confidence. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P62">The orthodox economists will turn and assert that they make no pretense that gold represents value, but is simply a focal point which is measurable, and is also where we can see it, namely with the United States Treasury or the Federal Reserve Banks. As a matter of record 14 the United States Treasury on Jan. I, 1922, held as assets, gold amounting to $ 380,188,972. Of this amount $ 152,979,025 is definitely ear marked as a fund to support the issue of Greenbacks, and the balance, $ 227,209,946 , is held against other obligations, such as National Bank Notes, Federal Reserve Notes and Federal Reserve Bank Notes.16 It does not belong to the Government :</text:p>

If Peter gets too ambitious and makes an advantageous loan to Germany, Paul is going to get panicky. But again it must be emphasized that there is no need to worry on this score. If Peter becomes too venture some the Government will assert its power and exercise control. This means however that we openly admit our allegiance to the fiat money class. The &quot; redeemability” of our obligations does not depend upon our ability to redeem : it depends, first, upon Peter&apos;s foreign ventures, second, upon Paul&apos;s alarm , and, finally , upon our ability to make terms with both of them at the expense of the exerters of effort. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63">The orthodox may further assert that even the small amount we have is ample for our needs. It is for the purpose of satisfying an uninterested demand ; but, however ample at the moment, it is not constant or calculable and therefore has no conceivable relationship to national economic value. Because of the very fact that we hold here in momentary custody all this stock of gold subject to individual demand, other so -called gold -standard countries are in a state of panic. They are not devoid of potential wealth -- fixed capital, equipment, ample acreage and a population eager to work ; but they are bare of raw material and are insulated in time and space by their lack of the conventional medium of exchange and the conventional guaranty of deferred payment. If their bidding for this vital token growsmore urgent, and faith becomes greater in their ability to break through our tariff barriers and tender services, there is nothing to prevent the loan of this gold to them at <text:span text:style-name="T42">a </text:span>handsome rate of interest by the present owners.16 As a con sequence, we may well be thrown into unnecessary confusion . This may sound absurd ; but following the crash of 1907 we were taught to be very grateful to certain financiers who saved us by <text:soft-page-break/>bringing back our basis of fundamental economic value- in a ship - at great sacrifice to the holders of real value 17 - here is the scientific absurdity ! </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P63">So bemuddled are we by economic ritual that we take the havoc for granted, though we know that in physics it would be preposterous. Imagine for a moment that the British Government were in a position to lend one half of their Empire at 8 % interest to Mars ; and, owing to the resulting shrinkage</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in the mass of the Earth, our physical units of value were correspondingly affected. Boundaries would overlap, velocities would alter and trajectories would have to be calculated anew . We would object strongly to this alien interference</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">both ) caused by fluctuations in &quot; value&quot; - or shall wemeasure it by the alterations in the prices of bonds which are a title to dollars, or stocks which are a title to goods and services ? The ritualist will again intervene at this point and say that these fluctuations have nothing to do with the gold -standard but are matters of over -production or under- production . Let us try to extend his horizon , for he is confusing cause and effect. General &quot; over -production &quot; is a classic myth : all it implies scientifically is maladjustment. We are witnessing the tragedy of frustrated economic flow , which , as history has repeatedly shown , is capable, if too long ignored , of transforming itself into exceedingly effective and uncontrollable physical motion : we call it revolt, and shudder. In mechanics we view it apprehensively as the heat arising from friction and hastily abate it by lubrication to prevent ruin . In the utilization of steam it is indicated on a gauge and eased before it blows the plant to pieces. In electricity it is light or heat or sudden death accord ing to our previous experience. In that most subtle form of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">energy which we have so far attempted to measure - radio activity -- it is a benign fluorescence or that particularly nasty phase of disintegration which we call the &quot; Becquerel burn .&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64">If the ritualists would read either history or physics with perception , they would not worry about over -production , but they would worry a thousand times more about our habit of interposing an arbitrary barrier to exchange, and our zest for penalizing effort, thus frustrating effective demand. </text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64">What they call &quot; over-production&quot; is either due to our archaic system of taxing need and effort, thus cutting down the factor of demand, or it is a foolish response by the producer to the fictitious &quot; gold-dollar&quot; which we still insist upon interposing between supply and demand . This acts as a bait, and just as soon as it is taken , and the trap sprung, we get logically enough under- production and unemployment. The producer and wage- earner in due time are let out of the trap - but upon terms. What we must try to arrive at are these terms if we are to measure the &quot; value&quot; of this havoc to the intelligent con troller of massed gold .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P64">Let us first realize that in a well-ordered community the co ordinated work of a thousand men upon ten thousand acres should constantly become more effective. This means that a fractional unit of, say, one man upon ten acres should steadily command more return . Upon this basis prices should have declined over an extended period, owing to growing co-ordination , just as an automobile runs more smoothly , a ship &quot; finds&quot; herself by use, or as the same kilowatt-hour gives us more value in a Tungsten lamp than it did in a Carbon lamp. But prices actually have risen , and this is not because of the very dubious &quot; law of diminishing returns&quot; which , even if it should prove valid , has certainly not yet emerged in the United States. We may have exhausted some of our oil-wells, but we have developed, up to date, hydro -electric energy per an num amounting to nearly 16 ,500 ,000 ,000 k. w . h . and it is estimated that we can look forward to an ultimate develop ment of 456,172,400,000 k .w .h . This is estimated to be the equivalent of the labor of 1520 million men per annum , and the cost, based upon past experience, is calculated to be not more than 11/2 cents per day per man -power . This is obviously something to set against the law of diminishing re turns. It is one of the first- fruits of freedom and order in the realm of physical economy. 18 </text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P64"><text:soft-page-break/>A valid unit of value, then , should buy more rather than less than it did in 1776 , and it is probable that the dollar does buy much more in the way of sanitation, education, convenience and order than we reckon .

   <text:p text:style-name="P65"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P65">There is, unfortunately , at this point a technical detail to be explained . If this, for the sake of the layman, is done very simply , there is a probability of offending both the engineer and the economist. However, facing this double risk , it is necessary to show that the full vibration reflected by prices</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is not revealed in the very concentrated &quot;price -curves&quot; we are accustomed to scan . These are a little like the charts upon</text:p>

Such a chart from 1910 to 1920 might show a benign ascending curve from year to year: but taken day by day there are very pregnant irregularities which represent some crisis when the child&apos;s life hung in the balance. In the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">same way the annual fluctuations of our unit of value may result in a curve which looks like the profile of a gently rolling country, but if charted month by month , resembles much more nearly the jawbone of a crocodile.

   <text:p text:style-name="P66">But the casualties of 1919 are light compared with the rout of 1920 and 1921. At many points we are driven back , as our enemies boast, to the old lines of 1915, and we have left behind us booty beyond reckoning which they are now engaged in picking up while they consolidate their gains. Flushed with victory, they sound their terrible battle -cry &quot; Deflation,&quot; their ranks swelled by an army of bond -holders who have deserted us in our retreat. Isolated groups, consisting of the stronger unions who were left behind, are still holding their ground, and for the moment the attack is being concentrated upon them , while the War Finance Corporation is acting the part of a Red-Cross unit, and taking care of the wounded in the devastated Iowa corn belt where there was unparalleled slaughter.23</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It is the loss incurred during these sudden raids that justifies us in speaking of the &quot; havoc-value&quot; of gold , particularly when we consider that no uniforms are worn, and thoughtless combatants suddenly change sides during the course of battle which only makes the havoc worse. Shylock caught Antonio</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">between the lines and had no hesitation in asserting that three thousand ducats were worth a pound of flesh taken from as close to the heart as possible . Portia intervened with a technicality to everyone&apos;s relief ; and the Court sustained her.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Nevertheless , vindictive as he was, as a conventional gold standard advocate, preaching deflation and insisting upon &quot;redeemable&quot; obligations, Shylock had a perfect case. He was thinking of gold in terms of its havoc-value, which rises at critical times far beyond its conventional worth . But, in the end, Shylock was glad to get away without losing his life ; and it is this discretion which will inevitably be called upon if the exerters of effort - the wage- earner , the farmer , the producer, the manufacturer, -- and the intermediate agents of exchange, - the banker , the carrier and the trader, - awake to their common handicap and state their common case.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ª The War Finance Corporation , with Mr. Eugene Meyer, Jr., as its very able head, has been empowered to the extent of about $ 320,000 ,000 to go to the assistance of the distressed producer through his banks and extend overdue loans. The banks for the time being have been saved from disaster. See speech by Mr . Meyer before the Commercial Club of San Francisco, March 29, 1922. The real meaning of this is, while deflation is preached, inflation is practiced .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P66">What is now advocated, for the sake of national economic freedom , is to take from gold and the title to gold , the disastrous control of value, and award this control to the holders of national area whose power and responsibility can be measured without personal appraisement-- first taking care , however, that every citizen may be encouraged and permitted to achieve title to land -area , this happy jointure of sovereignty and responsibility .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">To avoid any imputation of prejudice , it is safe to state that as far as the simple-minded holder of 1913 &quot; gold &quot; dollars is concerned , the havoc-value of gold was at least that disclosed by the index -numbers to which reference has been made. Two hundred and forty-three such &quot; gold &quot; dollars, expressed in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">terms of commodities, have dwindled in six years to the equivalent of one hundred similar dollars.25</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">However , the most distressing aspect of the matter is that we did not slide down a long, smooth chute designed to prevent breakage : we tumbled downstairs and have been bumped and bounced at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">every step ; so that the havoc was not only directly proportionate to the total fall, but was increased in proportion to the number of steps-- which is only another way of stating that the frequency of a vibration is more important than its amplitude or path .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">When all is said, it seems fairly obvious that we have taken over into democracy a unit of arbitrary power which we apologetically attempt to mitigate and make serviceable as a unit of value. As a scientific unit of value, our gold dollar beggars description. It not only suffers from an annual decline but, quite unlike any other scientific unit of value, it has spasms.</text:p>

No value, however simple, can be measured except in terms of the ultimate limits which define it : and this applies in geometry, physics and dynamics - in every scientific method of measuring value except the method of the political-economist.

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the political-economist&apos;s craving &quot; to make three bites of a cherry &apos; - and at that he is often onebite short. The orthodox teachers employ these three terms, and fail to emphasize the</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the capacity of his pump before measuring the capacity of his</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is that value may be determined by what men will give for a privately -owned and occasionally unavailable commodity of unknown total quantity - namely gold .

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">been his difficulty, in spite of the fact that he lays down such a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">praiseworthy moral code for his wayward unit. The economic &quot; law of supply and demand&quot; has been em ployed to cover a multitude of sins. It is obviously not a law but a travesty of law unless the demand is in orderly contact with the supply. If this is carefully considered it becomes more clearly apparent that taxation , the cost of providing order, is an integral component of value, and must also be an integral component of any scientific measure of value. In other words, there is no such thing as measurable eco nomic value where we have either autocracy or anarchy. Bound</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">less effort is not measurable : boundless freedom is not measur able ; but with the metamorphosis of effort into freedom , in a definite area of self -imposed order, value becomes a measurable</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">relation between gold and economic value is a pitiful delusion ,</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">agents of freedom , thus giving it value and making much of it available for exchange. Some phases of freedom , or value, are inexchangeable, such as the good health arising from thor ough mastication, or the enjoyment of a picture, as we can</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fortunately realize these for ourselves, without the inter</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">vention of any &quot; entrepreneur&quot; or labor-union : another phase</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of freedom , or value, namely that arising from good govern</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ment, which we create jointly for joint-account, is also nor</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mally inexchangeable, though this is only because we have half forgotten the conventions of brigands and emperors who re alized the value of freedom and appraised it in terms of ransom and indemnity ; and being &quot; gold -standardists&quot; and practical internationalists in good standing they demanded bullion as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the measure of value, so that they mightmove away from a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">naturally unfriendly jurisdiction as quickly as possible. The only reason these latter values do not appear to be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot; economic&quot; in the ordinary sense, is that they are not directly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">exchangeable. Economic value is logically due, therefore, to effective effort induced by the hope of freedom , within a zone of self-imposed</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">order and , under democracy , can only be vitiated by undemo</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cratic arbitraries. It is, however , equally important to realize</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that this value is definitely limited by measurable factors, since</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">measurable as modified by self -imposed order within that area , we must admit further that such value can only bemeas ured in terms of its dominating limits by means of a unit ex</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pressing the reciprocal relationship of these limits and the</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">effort and order in the medium of matter, limited by popula</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tion, area and time, constitutes our ultimate economic supply . Our ultimate demand is the desire for ever ampler freedom , which is also limited by population , area and time. Orderly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">flow is ensured ; and we can immediately measure the value of any interior effort in terms of this flow . To need and fail to obtain is an obvious limitation of free</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dom . To desire and fail to obtain is also a limitation, even if</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the object of our desire is a jewel or a picture. While the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">need and desire of such freedom may both appear to be ab stractions, nevertheless these are essential components of the conventional demand of the economist. If sufficiently urgent they ensure effort.</text:p>

The really appalling abstraction -- if it is fair to call sheer delusion by this name-- is our belief that the value of human effort is in any way related to an unmeasurable store of gold , held in individual and alien ownership . Abstract as the economic equivalent of dynamic value may appear, we have at least under such a conception , available within democracy, as a definite &quot;measure of value,&quot; as a &quot;me dium of exchange,&quot; as a &quot; basis for deferred payment&quot; and as</text:p>

Our unit of partial value fails to represent the remainder of our</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It is, perhaps, only fair to the reader to attempt to recon centrate this general examination of economic value.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The political-economists have concerned themselves chiefly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with supply , disregarding both demand and the medium of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">contact. They have devoted their attention to material</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">products instead of the effective effort which can be induced by the possible gratification of our growing desire for ampler</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">freedom . Because of their preoccupation they make only</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cloudy distinctions between effort, facilities and value . The followers of Marx speak of effort as though it were value. The followers of Henry George speak of facilities as though</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">they were value. And yet overlapping, colliding and disput</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ing, as they do , they have covered the truth between them .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Some of them have properly described effort, or labor, as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the &quot; source of value,&quot; others have described facilities as &quot; use -value,&quot; or &quot; site -value,&quot; and most of them have defined value itself as &quot; exchange-value,&quot; or &quot;marginal utility .&quot; &quot; Mar</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ginal utility&quot; is an interesting recognition of the dividing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">line between value and facilities. When a man has two gallons</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of water for sale in a drought, this water commands effective effort and therefore has economic value. When he and others</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>have 10 ,000 gallons between them , this water commands less</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">effective effort and therefore has less value per gallon . When there is a river available the water has no economic value. It</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is a facility only and not an inducement.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">What has confused the student of economics so long is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the failure to distinguish between the cause of value (force ), the condition of value ( friction ) , and value itself (effective work ) . In dynamics we recognize only one value, namely, effective</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ness ; but we recognize two contributing factors which go to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">make up this value : one is prime force; the other is resistance or facility, whichever way we care to express it. The electrician has a different unit to measure each of these</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">qualities. He measures cause by volts, condition by ohms, and value by amperes.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The economist, unfortunately for us, employs the same word for effort, facility and effect, calling them all value, as, for example, when he speaks of the value of effort, the value of an ample municipal water supply, and the value of a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bottle of champagne. Curiously enough, the bottle of cham pagne- a luxury -- is the only item on this list that has scien</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tific economic value, since it is the only thing that has the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">quality of inducing effective effort.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Because our &quot;measure of value&quot; does not express our senti mental appraisement of the three qualities -- effort, facility</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and effectiveness -- we become confused .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Labor is effort, but is not value: it may be quite ineffective,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as we all know .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">An ample community water supply is a facility , but it is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not value: it amplifies effort but does not call it forth . The champagne, however , has economic value, since it is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">capable of commanding effective effort as its price ; and such</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">effort is rendered more effective by the municipal water supply , owing to the fact that it is not diverted by the necessity of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">having to stop and dig wells.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Long before we have defined economic value and learned</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to measure it, we have wasted countless time in trying to legislate it into motion . From an engineering point of view</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">, or, conversely, Effort X Conductivity -- this is economic value. Neither effort nor conductivity is value. Value is the mathematical product of the two, and cannot be measured by a single dimension . The construction of a scientific measure of economic value is probably the greatest possible contribution that can be made to the flow of effective effort, since there is created a vital</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">facility, which does much more than add to value : it mul</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tiplies it. When we speak of a measure of value, then , we are not speaking of a measure of effort, or a measure of conductivity ;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but we are speaking of a measure of effectiveness which is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">forever momentarily slaking the human demand for ampler</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">freedom -- but forever recreating a supply to validate this demand. At the same time that effective individual effort is creating new inducements for old , joint effort is adding facility to facility. For this reason our total sum of value does not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">diminish or stand constant. It is continually expanding and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">submerging the economists with their &quot; wage- funds&quot; and their &quot; laws of diminishing returns.&quot; Before passing on to the next point to be discussed, let us consider as briefly as possible the result of the acceptance of such a conception of economic value as is now put forward . If population increases , and if general co -ordination and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">invention increase, even as much as they have in the past, the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">holder of a census-area-order unit in 1950 will still have a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">certificate representing measurable basic economic value. If</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it is a dollar it will still be the expression of a definite fraction of the effort of total population , as modified by the cost of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">order, on total acreage for all time. If the population doubles, the holder will have a unit based on half the area but it will</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">represent the same scientific value as the unit he had in 1920.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">If co-ordination were doubly effective, he would becomemore aware of its value. If profitable invention (which is nothing</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">more than the elimination of friction ) continued the value</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">175</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would be still more obvious. It would be worth while to save, and very foolish to waste, such a dollar.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Now this would not mean that the unit had increased in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">relative value: it would be still exactly what it was -- let us say oneman-acre - an explicit share in basic potentialities. It</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would mean logically just one thing, namely that friction had been eliminated -- the disastrous friction due to ignorance, to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">disorder , to erratic taxation, to an invalid measure of value</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">We are now so stunted mentally by economic ritual that any</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">proposal looking toward basic readjustment results in the flinging of epithets ; and &quot; Single -Tax&quot; is a very convenient</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reproach to hurl at anyone who suggests that land -area is a factor mathematically involved in themeasurement of the con</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">trol of economic value and the corresponding responsibility.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">While it is contended that, under any rational conception of economic value, taxation should be as compound as the value itself and should be based on the occupancy -value of area , per unit of time, nevertheless it is well worth while making a very careful examination of the proposals ofHenry George to ascer tain , if possible, why Single- Tax has become so effective an epithet. Single-Tax In the field of political economy, as in that of theology , there</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">has been , for a long time past, a danger of the layman be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">coming confused and wearied by endless expert controversy over irrelevant detail. This arises partly from the fact that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">some of the most vital words in our language are tinctured with misconceptions, or conceptions which have been repu diated , and other focal points lack final definition ; so that any</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">statement, at the best, is inexact and subject to valid criticism ,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the intensity of which obscures more important basic con</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">siderations. Controversy also arises from the fact that while we have dispersed and apportioned political power , the dis position of economic power has largely been a matter of catch-as-catch-can ; and we have not apportioned the corre</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sponding responsibility. Under these circumstances it is not</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">political freemen wheeling distractedly within closing economic</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">barriers, it is appalling to hear the serious citizen say lightly that he knows nothing of economics. It is probable that he is not nearly as ignorant as he thinks ; but, for all of us, there is urgently required some simple and fundamental conception</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a conception which will permit comprehension but which must</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">also survive examination. It was undoubtedly with a perception of our desire for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">simplification , and moved by the aggregate miseries of man</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">kind, that Henry George stepped boldly into the field and en deavored to reduce to final simplicity all our difficulties and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">all our remedies. The response to his teaching has been so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">eager that it seems almost ungrateful to question whether the cost, in terms of ultimate advantage, is not too great to pay</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for sheer simplicity. It would be callous indeed to ignore the earnestness of his effort. &quot; Progress and Poverty&apos; should be</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and his synthetic remedy, there is a hopeless chasm . Through</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with the least exertion.&quot; From this very doubtful assumption he leaves for himself no avenue of escape ; and, realizing the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hopeful and compassionate heart of the man , one is almost</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">forced to regard it as the gesture of a conjurer -- an airy plea to believe that he has nothing in the way of sentimentalism up</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as attraction is inseparable from matter.&quot; 1 With the sternness of vivisection he has resolutely laid bare</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">inertia , and insists that this is the very heart of human nature ; and if he fails to convince us that he is indeed a cold blooded investigator, it is not for lack of assertion. And it is Henry George himself who encourages us to look forward confidently</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to an equally relentless examination by him of the effects of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is to be ushered in with his remedy. He states, &quot; The great</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">osophic shortsightedness in those who regard it as the &quot;master</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tor. It is probable , therefore , that this principle will be more</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and more clearly defined and scrutinized with increase of population (the most feared yet most advantageous contribu tion to value) and decrease of individual opportunity through</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">state , or state-sanctioned , absorption ( the most dangerous and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">least apparent impairment of value) . More than this, the</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">far from being able to redeem our gold obligations in gold as the French were from being able to redeem their land obliga tions in land. Wemay, however, through political power, or</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">places our obligations in the irredeemable category. Irredeemability Such a type ofmoney as is here proposed, being based upon</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Now if redeemable literally means redeemable (as in the case</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mally redeemable (as in the case of a sale of &quot; futures&quot; in</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that it has behind it a stored -up portable commodity available for handing over upon demand to the holder of the paper. It</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">money is not redeemable in gold upon demand. This is shown by the record ,18 and it was demonstrated by bitter experience during the panic of 1893 in the United States, when gold could</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">not be imported quickly enough to avert disaster, and in the</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there is, quite properly and commendably , the idea of value but it is unfortunately only an idea -- not a guarantee ; and ,more</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">may have to be faced. The acceptance has been urged of the following points : That in a region of self-imposed order themeasurable com</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ponents of basic economic value are three, namely , land-area ,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">population and time.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">That while time measures the duration of effort, the only</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">measurable container of this effort is land , which has one constant and calculable characteristic , namely, surface-area ,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">since this dimension cannot be impaired either by the state or</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">by any individual.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">That effort, in the aggregate, is proportional to population ; but, lacking autocratic compulsion, depends severally upon the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">impulse of the individual, which appears to have two main characteristics, being either grudging or eager . That grudging effort (which is probably a direct reflex of maladjustment) can only be compelled by one of two methods:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">( a ) coercion by authority ( illogical under self-govern</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ment) ; or,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">( b ) the impersonal coercion of need, which, however , ceases</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to function themoment that need has been satisfied .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">That eager or willing effort, therefore, under democracy, is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the sole source of the reserves necessary to safeguard the com</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">munity and maintain continuity of advantageous operations.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">That any inducement of effort, to be effective, should be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">incapable of debasement. That remuneration incapable of debasement under democ racy can only be a lien on land -area valued in terms of popula</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tion -density, and guaranteed by the full prepayment of the</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">That taxation , or the cost of order , being a pre-requisite of</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">value, namely , land -area , population and time. These steps indicate that economic value, in an area where</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there is a condition of self-imposed order , is determined in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">end by the area-factor in relation to the constant factor of time and to measurable population. It indicates just as clearly that annual taxation must be measured on the basis of census</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a tax on census-area alone has some parallel features. Both</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">RECAPITULATION</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">This is largely reiteration for the sake of emphasis; and is an extended index of the foregoing arguments. It is designed to amplify the contention that economics must primarily be a study of basic control, maximum development, and just meas</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">urement of human effort, and not, as the ritualists appear to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">take for granted, an appraisal in arbitrary terms of certain</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">results of that effort no matter how grossly impeded. Long after the strongholds of theocracy and autocracy have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">been razed to the ground , it would seem as though the science of economics, less fortunate than her sister - sciences, has been</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">discovered still shackled in an underground dungeon ; and that since this partial liberation the political-economists have spent</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">their ingenuity in classifying various lurching and illogical</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">motions which are due to the shackles.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">To take up, one by one, the disablements and show that they are not functional, even though they may be predicted with some skill, and to contest, step by step, fine- spun disputation as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to the consequences of free motion plus a ball and chain under varying conditions, is to bury the reader in an avalanche of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">words.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">What we must realize is that, as far as democracy is con cerned, the study of economics is fundamentally the study of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the value of liberated human effort ; and we must then deter</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mine, first, the basic limits of this value, so that it may bemeas ured ; and, second, we must keep a close watch for friction , so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that there may be no wasteful political interference.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The first duty of the scientific economist, then, should be an honest attempt to provide a means of measuring the values available within any definite political boundaries which encircle</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a zone of freedom .</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">If he erect the whole structure of his science on a founda tion which includes both unmeasurable and secondary factors, some vague approximations may of course be arrived at ; just as, without any measurement of cross - section and velocity some</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">approximation of the hydraulic value of a stream of water may</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">be arrived at by comparative methods, working on the unsatis</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">factory basis of the resultant of an unknown flow , modified by</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">equally unknown factors of leakage and friction. However,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">if all the available value were being gradually consumed by leakage or friction, the unfortunate scientist, calculating on this unscientific basis, would under such conditions in honesty be compelled to resign , owing to a disappearance of his factors , such as is taking place today in Russia where the factors of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot; Land -value&quot; (measured in terms of rent) , &quot; Labor&quot; (meas</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ured in terms of output), &quot; Capital&quot; (measured in terms of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">gold ) , and &quot;Organization &quot; (measured in terms of efficiency ) ,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">are melting before the economists&apos; eyes. Almost the only</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">economic factor left with any credentials is Pigou&apos;s &quot;Uncer tainty-bearing.&quot; 1</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">After having arrived at a means ofmeasurement of the value of liberated human effort, the problems of minimum control,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">maximum development and just distribution are equally im</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">portant; but these are futile considerations until we know with</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">what we have to deal. Now the chief difficulty in negotiating with the orthodox</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">economist is thathe does not treat economics as a clean science,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">but in a spirit ofmournfulresignation deals with it as a mixture of formal ritual and the art of administration. That he has mentally committed himself to this medley may be seen by</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his readiness to treat &quot; Nature,&quot; &quot;Capital,&quot; &quot; Land-value&quot; and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">special phases of Labor as primary factors. Under these cir</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cumstances, the only thing to do is to jerk him a little roughly</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from his scientific pedestal and talk to him frankly .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">In olden times when a discussion became so involved that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">there was no hope of settlement, it was considered good form</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The challenge to the political-economist takes this form :</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ignoring the basic conditions of your problem . Your factors</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">themselves are not measurable : you cannot co -ordinate them</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">nor show any integral relationship between your phenomena.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ward . The basic trouble is not that democracy is a faulty insti</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mob motiveswithout any clear perception in economic terms of what we were repudiating. We have gained politically but suffered economically, largely because our apologetic econo</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">into democracy, have been busy classifying and analyzing the products of a faulty and congested economic system . Their</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">excuse may well be that they are looking at things as they</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">are- not as they should be. This , though it is their proffered</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as they are -- and, what is more serious, they are possibly worse</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">than they were. If we do not get down to fundamentals there</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">may well be more and more involved symptoms to classify,</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">application . The argument may well have been clouded by</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">ception of this. At the outset he is so close to the engineer&apos;s conception</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">are always three vital points to be considered ; and these are so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">definitely interdependent that no alteration can be made in one</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">supply and effective demand are now conspicuously ill-balanced,</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is the simplest possible way of disclosing the fact that such a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lack of balance exists. It has been shown very fully that a scientific unit of dynamic value must represent total value, and that total value is the ratio between total effort and total resistance. I&quot; is at this point that the scientist and the ritualist part</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">company. A so-called unit of value which takes no cognisance of the negative components of economic value, is scien</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tifically as ludicrous as a foot-pound -second would be if it had</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">been deliberately arranged that Saturn need only come to heel</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in the solar system at the periodic whistle of some erratic tax</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">collector. A demonstration that the structure of our present unit of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">value is unscientific should be spur enough to the economist . But we are so used to the fact that it is unscientific and so</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hardened to the sight of economic distress that &quot; unscientific&quot; by now has no sting. Our unit of value is not only unscien tific : being clearly subject to retroactive debasement, it is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">spurious and normally irredeemable , if we think in terms of value instead of gold .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Under the one rationalizing condition of self-imposed order,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">or national equilibrium , the basic economic calculations are almost unbelievably simple. Supply and demand turn out to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">be identical, being nothing more than the two facial aspects of the same cross-section of flow . On any given section the quality of economic value in relation to the quality of total</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">value may be expressed quantitatively in terms of total area</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and population -density .</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Within such a total area , in the medium ofmatter , or physical</text:p>

In the same area , and in the same medium , we have also another form of demandan equally long series of differentials expressing the desire and conception of order , and, induced by this, a complementary</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The sobering thought, in the last analysis, is that we are dealing with desires and efforts, which are almost impossible to quicken and very easy to thwart. In discussing detail we are promptly involved in idiosyncra sies of desire and effort beyond enumeration ; but our two sets of series, as a whole , may be stated in terms of their means, with the saving of much mental wear and tear, since these two conceptions of the supply and demand of freedom ( flow ) , and the supply and demand of order ( conductivity) ,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">may be expressed by the common dimensions of population</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">We may leave the scrupulous mathematical economist to</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the knowledge that Alpha, Lambda and Omega are in reality</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot; buddies&quot; -- the economic equivalents of Mulvaney, Ortheris and Learoyd -- who as soon as the wearisome parade is over</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">will turn with zest to their own absorbing economic activities.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">But we have now got them all in the parade-ground . What we desire is not a discussion of their idiosyncrasies but a rational conception of the &quot; value in action &quot; of this ill-assorted squad in a given area . We bid them charge across the area</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">allotted to them , in open order , and scale the many obstructions</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">As economists we contemplate this phenomenon and inter pret it in terms of &quot; diminishing returns&quot; and &quot;marginal utility.&quot; As mathematicians we use our stop-watches and</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">enlarged economic unit well worth consideration.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Let us assume that this unit consists of 100 acres with a population of 200 souls. The potential economic value of</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Total gross value ( 100 X 200) = 20,000 man -acre-hours.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The total effective value would obviously be modified by the basic resistance of the area - climate and infertility of soil</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and also the diminishable resistance - lack of roads, lack of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">schools, and lack of sanitation .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Now let us assume that these difficulties are so great that the work of only ten of these men yields a net margin . In this case the total net economic value per hour is 100 acres x 10</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">men or 1,000 man -acre-hours. If the resistance is cut in half by road -building, schools and plumbing, then the work of 105 men becomes effective and our effective value per hour becomes 100 acres x 105 men , or</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">10 ,500 man -acre-hours.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">If the resistance is again cut in half the work of 152. 5 men becomes effective and our economic value per hour is 152.5</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">men X 100 acres, or 15,250 man-acre-hours.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The resistance in this simple example has been reduced in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the ratio of 4 to 1 : the effective value has been increased in</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the ratio of 1 to 15.25. This is the explanation of what we</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">effort and resistance.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">. Now this community , being entirely free of the habit of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">raising an exportable surplus as imperial tribute, and equally free of the gold -standard tradition, would be able to give rational consideration to the construction of a scientific unit</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Survey descendants, congenitally hungry for equations that</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would be driven back to their least common denominators, area , density and time, - in terms of which the cost of over coming resistance , and the measure of value, can both be im personally expressed.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The difference between the engineer and the economist is this : the engineer knows that he can express total potential</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">effort and the total sum of resistance in common measurable</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">terms, even if he is not sure of total value ;&apos; while the econo mist, with his water-tight conceptions of several different kinds</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of value, makes the fatal error of ignoring altogether the cost</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of overcoming resistance. Here lies all the difference be tween relative precision and hopeless confusion .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">We have accepted gold in the past as a measure of value only because there was no conception of a definite zone of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">freedom ; and the best that could be said of economic value was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that it was the uncertain mitigation of our servitude to an arbi trary of some kind or other. &quot;We face, therefore, under democracy, if it is concerned with unimpairable freedom , the imperative necessity of expressing total basic national value in terms of its ultimate limits; and,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">having accomplished this, of expressing all fractional values by</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a comprehensive unit which is integrally related to the whole,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">instead of being a definite number of ounces of some unmeas</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">LET us discuss in more detail the symptoms, which have</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">already been indicated in Part I. These appear to establish</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">definitely the fact that we are employing an unscientific and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">entirely unreliable unit of measurement. Among the more significant of these are the following :</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">( a ) Lack of certainty as to the true value of savings and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the wisdom of attempting to save. We all know that the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">demand power of the so -called &quot; gold &quot; dollar has diminished</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from a rated effectiveness of 100 per cent in 1913 to a rated</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">effectiveness of about 41 per cent in 1920 , in terms of certain</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">essential goods.1</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Now if this had been due to an arbitrary issue of &quot; fiat&quot; money instead of the conversion of credit into so -called gold</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">obligations, the political party in power during such a period would be blamed withoutmercy by the defenders of our present system ; but because it was due to our ignorant worship of the gold -standard and to consequences arising from an attempt to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">procure low -interest loans for the Government from both high</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and lowly, in the name of patriotism , it was regarded com</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">placently by the orthodox , who could look forward, later on , to picking up these jointly -endorsed promises to pay in gold</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">1920 be worth less than half their initial value, and the citizen who denied his wants in the name of thrift might well regard himself as something</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of January 6 , 1923, quotes one of its experts, Mr. Louis G .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Michael, …conomist in Foreign Agriculture , who has recently made a study of agricultural economic conditions in Europe</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">THE ECONOMICS OF FREEDOM</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for the Department. In part, Mr. Michael states as follows :</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot; Formerly Roumania was a great wheat exporting country, 59. 3 per cent of production finding its way onto the Western European market to compete with American - grown grain . This export of grain was possible only because wheat bread</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">eating was restricted to city population and the upper classes, who consumed about 792 pounds per capita per year. Had the peasants consumed a like amount of wheat there would</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">have been little for shipment abroad.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot; In all countries in Southeastern Europe, with the exception</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of Bulgaria , this same condition of affairs obtained -- the peas ant was undernourished, his diet was without variety, and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">food that he should have consumed to keep himself in good</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">physical condition was taken from him to meet excessive taxes or exorbitant land rents. He was virtually the slave of the large land owner and the state.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot; To-day that is changed , the peasant is beginning to eat</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">bread ; after centuries of submerged individuality he is taking</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his place among his own peoples as a man , despite the obstruc</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tions of the great lords and the opposition of the cities. The peasant&apos;s wife is demanding to be better clothed , even buying satins that she calls &apos;the cloth that goes swish -swish .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot; The fact that the peasant is eating bread is causing a revo lution throughout Southeastern Europe that extends even into</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Middle Europe. This revolution is better known as the land</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">reform . The peasant, brought to a realization of his power by the great war, demanded enough land on which to produce</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a decent living for his wife and children. His demand was a threat and he got the land. He has begun to feed his wife</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and children not only bread, but also meat-- a former Sunday</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">luxury. He is growing upon his land the things he wants to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">grow for his own use . . . . &quot; All this is having a peculiar effect upon the national eco nomics of the various countries in which he lives. The big estates organized their operations about wheat production as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a center, the wheat to be sold for cash and the cash to be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">expended in the great luxury centers of Paris, Venice, Berlin , but not in the country where the wealth was produced . Con sequently these countries were left poor, their resources being</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pumped out annually to give a few weeks of pleasure abroad</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to the upper classes. . . .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/></text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot; Then the great change came. The peasant, who had formerly slaved to produce the exportable grain excesses, be gan to work for himself and in the interest of his own imme</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cut down to more nearly that required to meet local needs.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Naturally also there was a drop in the yield per acre and then</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">on top of this the peasant and his family began to eat wheat.</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">were for and by the ruling class, and when one realizes that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the peasant, the common man , is better off to-day than he has ever been before, one cannot help but feel that the time has come for the governments to adjust themselves to the new</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">order.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">In a further comment, Mr. Michael adds:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot; The large estates, in time passed, produced vast amounts</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of wheat-- the whole farm organization being built up around</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wheat production , just as in Iowa it is built up around corn</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and hog production.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">These large owners had no patriotic</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">motive in growing wheat. They grew wheat for the cash it brought them and that cash was expended largely abroad at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the luxury centers -- Paris, Berlin . But they produced much</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">more wheat than the cities ate ( the peasants ate but little white bread ) and the excess was exported abroad . This created a</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">balance of trade in favor of the exporting nation and kept its</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">money up to par. . . .</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Let us try to get in narrow compass a picture of what has</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">been happening in our commonwealth during the last few</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">years owing to such methods, or, more properly , to such lack of method, and of how disastrous to many has been our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">failure to make an attempt at measurement. In the first place we have jointly issued national obligations, to the amount of over 23 billion dollars, which we have promised to repay in gold. Of this vast sum we have collectively very little left. Part of it has been credited to the owners of the goods and</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">services we needed , and debited to various nations, some of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">which cannot possibly repay us . While we shall only get back a small portion of this amount into our Treasury, and as a nation shall get back nothing of the large amount which was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wasted owing to the necessity of haste, nevertheless we are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pledged to pay back in gold every cent to those who lent us their credit with which to wage warfare. They did not lend us gold , for we know that there was not more than a fraction</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of that amount of gold in existence. We credited them with so- called value and rashly agreed to return gold instead. Put</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">inflated credit instruments of individual stockholders, and our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">directors agreed to make good these optimistic acceptances in gold at a later date . Then , as stockholders, we voted to ratify and hold ourselves fully responsible for the acts of our directors ,</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">assuming full stockholders&apos; liability , as we quite properly should</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to quote a very genuine appeal for adjustment, such as the above, in contending that the gospel of deflation has some tremendous implications apart from its prima facie virtue, let us turn back and see what one of our leading economists</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">thought of it before the situation was so acute. as follows: Professor</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">H . G . Moulton, of the University of Chicago, in 1916 , stated</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Obligations payable in money that are entered into at one price level may be payable at a future date when the prices</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">may be substantially lower or substantially higher. If lower, the borrower finds that he has to repay a greater purchasing power than he received, or, what is more to the point, he finds it difficult in consequence of lower prices (and wages ) to repay</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">his loan than would have been the case at the former level of prices.&quot; 1</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The foregoing is a general picture of our present extraor dinary situation , and gives some idea of what deflation involves. It may be worth while to take two specific details in this picture and look at them still more closely : During our period of national emergency, every one was</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">asked to lend, particularly those in modest circumstances. They</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">they were coerced . It was quite properly everybody&apos;s war at</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this stage, and inflation of credit was practised in the name of loyalty ( just as deflation is now urged in the name of thrift ). All this was magnificent, and we were proud of each other; but that is no reason why we should be blind to what</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">was actually happening because of our fluctuating dollar which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">is immune from inspection or correction by any competent</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">inspector of weights or measures. During the period of in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">flation , inspired by our Treasury Department, the loyal citizen</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in modest circumstances pledged his hundred dollars for the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">common cause ,mainly with a fine pride which was the measure</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of his patriotism . If he had not actually the hundred dollars</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to lend , his banker validated his intentions, and the Federal</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Reserve Bank assisted his banker. This era of good-faith and helpfulness went on for as long as was necessary to raise</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">themoney . But,with the validation of so much credit, a flood</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of purchasing power was released, and prices started to climb,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">since all these contributions of credit, large or small, were</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">placed in the hands of various government departments by</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&apos; See pages 62 and 63 of the hearings entitled &quot; Reviving the Activities</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the War Finance Corporation ,&quot; before the Senate and House Com mittees on Agriculture, Dec. 3, 1920. The Governor of the Federal Re serve Board there testified as follows: &quot; The Federal Reserve Board adopted a policy in order to assist in the war financing which was economically unsound . I say this frankly. Con gress authorized certain loans. It authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to determine the rates at which the loans should be issued . The Secretary of the Treasury asked the advice of experts and then fixed the rates of interest to be borne by the several issues of bonds, notes, and certificates. During the time we were actually at war, something like $ 18 ,000 ,000 ,000 of bonds were sold to the people, an amount cer</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tainly in excess of the normal investment power of the American people</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in such a short time, and the only way in which those loans could be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">financed was through the instrumentality of the banks. The only way</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the banks could undertake to do it was to get some assistance from the Federal Reserve Banks and at a low rate. The low rate of interest borne</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">by these bonds was fixed with a view of holding down the expenses of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the Government as far as possible. Anyway, that is something the Fed eral Reserve Board has no responsibility for. In order to make possible the floating of these bonds we fixed a rate less than their coupon rate. Some member banks announced that for a period of six months there</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would be a rate of 474 per cent on notes secured by Government obliga</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>tions. The result was there was no loss to subscribing banks pending the distribution of the bonds to the public . There were successive bond issues. The principal reason why discount rates were not increased</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">earlier than they were in 1919 was on account of Treasury financing.&quot;</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and they encouraged them to outbid each other for labor and</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">him to gold dollars. Government spending ceased, and later, after the excitement was over, the gospel of deflation was ushered in with all the fervor of a religious revival, despite the general knowledge that this, if acquiesced in , means that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">those in modest circumstances, through indirect taxation , will have to pay back to the stronger lenders who were not frozen out, and to the later traders, who bought from the weaker at</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a discount, three or four times as much in goods and services</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as the weaker obtained for their certificates.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The other detail in the picture is that of the cautious in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dividual who picked up these $ 100.00 certificates for about</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">So far, what has been sketched is a general picture of our economic situation ; but within this assumed equilibrium , as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Jevons puts it, we pull, push, lift, press and carry ; and it should be apparent that the value of these interior efforts can</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">only be measured in terms of the equilibrium . When we lift a weight from the earth we also lift the whole earth a little</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">at the same time; since we have upset a balance which both</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the weight and the earth promptly make an effort to adjust.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">In the same way, when we exert an advantageous effort in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">our assumed economic equilibrium , the whole sum of national</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">wealth is properly involved until the disturbance is adjusted . Now , for the sake of the simple mathematics involved , let us consider the dimensions of our national economic unit. We</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">must enlarge our raft to an area of 1,903,215, 360 acres and</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">below them , without any question , are the rapids. The effort</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of this crew has put our gigantic economic raft in the position where it now floats quietly on the stream of adversity . The</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">value of this vantage point is our true national wealth . That we employ the Bureau of the Census to tally this wealth , or value, item by item , in termsof an unknown number of ounces</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of gold , owned by someone else, is just our primitive way of</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">basis for economic science . Logical and spontaneous reactions, for the first time, could be counted upon , and these became</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">measurable because they took place within cleanly -defined limits. From that point forward, we had definite factors to deal with . The constant dynamic force is due to the need of man for the bare essentials of bodily freedom and his desire for a growing amplification of that freedom . This force is in</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">The question &quot; How do you propose to remedy matters ?&quot; is a perfectly fair one, but a very dangerous one for a diag nostician to attempt to answer as briefly. The farm -adviser</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">OUR UNPLEASANT ALTERNATIVES</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">UNDER the conditions already indicated we are faced logi cally as a nation, with one of three fairly definite alternatives. The alternative we choose will depend very largely upon our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">national reaction to intolerable pressure, as we grow fully</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">aware of it. The three channels open to us are :</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">First, Economic bondage to the holders of our newly created</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot; gold-dollar.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Second, Repudiation of our so -called gold -dollar by revo</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">lution .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Third, Partial repudiation ( or dilution ) of our so -called gold - dollar by legislative process. Under the first alternative, if as a nation we are capable</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of taking pressure as meekly as is hoped, and urged in the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">name of thrift, by those who now stand unharmed after our cyclone of inflation and deflation, we shall settle down</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for from twenty to fifty years of patient and truly exemplary service to our newly created aristocracy. This is most unlikely .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">However thankless the task of waking a dreamer to realities, these innocent advocates of the virtues of resignation and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">meekness should be told at once that what they dream will not come true. The second avenue wemay follow , namely, the repudiation of our so -called gold -dollars by revolution , will only be taken if our reaction to pressure is violent. If our natural good sense has been too dangerously diluted by the past flood of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">unscrutinized immigrants with their prejudice against order ,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it is possible that as a nation wemay rise up, and withoutmuch</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">also unlikely since the education that comes from ownership</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of property (in spite of the unequally distributed tax -burden</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that rests upon it ) will cause us to realize that we are all</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">dependent upon our closely interwoven social structure. The third avenue we may take is repudiation of onerous</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">obligations by lurching and unmeasured inflation ; that is, we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">hoarded by the foolish or exported by the well-informed, and as a consequence the supply can be diminished by individual action . We are informed later.

The major equity imposed by the duty of keeping the weight of the coinage uniform , under our present system ,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">involves us in a palpable inequity at the moment of readjust ment. In the same way, if for the sake of general equity we</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">decide to convert our so -called gold -standard of value into</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a scientific census-area standard of value, an arbitrary point has to be chosen. Essentially the problem is very similar to</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">raising a cry of injustice. The day that a bushel of oats was declared to be 32 lbs., and was thrown into just relationship</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">were accustomed to thresh their oats when they were in good condition : on the other hand a great many were injured who were careless about their seed and harvesting, and whose prod uct was coarse and bulky. For this reason any remedy can</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">only be stated in general terms. Wemay all agree that the bushel is an absurd measure of value ; but the farmer with the sound dry oats will maintain that the legalized bushel should be 38 pounds, while the farmer with the coarse and bulky</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">oats will contend that it should be 26 pounds. If we compro</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">for the sake of the greater advantage of creating general confi</text:p>

This fact is as valid a material clew as the entrance fee to a spiritualistic sÈance, and is well worth consideration .

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">take for granted that our wealth would also have increased</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in the same ratio : this would give us an estimated total wealth of 111.05 billion dollars. But we have also to take into con sideration that the &quot; 1912&quot; dollar was only worth about 8 %101</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">legend, convention and the absurd stigma of usury, is simply</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the hourly effort men will exert, over and above what is neces sary for their sustenance, in return for the certified freedom ,</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">definite rental value as we can see by the daily quotations in the money market. All that is novel in the foregoing argu ment is the contention that this value should be measured as</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">obvious point so long is that it is necessary to demonstrate</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to the layman (who is most involved, and least concerned )</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that the employment of our present so -called &quot; gold &quot; dollar as</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a measure of value is not only useless but is tragic. And apologies are quite properly due to the scientist, for it must be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">admitted that the calculations just made are futile. The dollar</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">side of the equations means nothing until we elect the moment of conversion ; and the estimated yield has no validity for several reasons, which may be stated as follows:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">First. The yield we have been discussing is not only based</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">upon so-called &quot; gold&quot; dollars, which have no more scientific meaning than &quot; brass&quot; kilowatts ; but it has unfortunately no</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">relation to the net product of current effort limited by area and</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">time in a region of order, since it disregards a vital inverse fac</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">tor, owing to our incalculable postponements of taxation ,which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">will later be imposed upon those luckless producers of value who fall under the jaundiced eye of the &quot; progressive&quot; ; and,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">still later , be imposed upon the more helpless thrifty who see</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"><text:soft-page-break/>the demand value of their tokens of value diluted by whimsical</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">adjustments called &quot; reform .&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Second. What we have been dealing with as net yield is the product of a flow deplorably choked by arbitrary friction</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">indeed we are fortunate to have any net yield to discuss; for</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">we have apparently accumulated much of it by defrauding the</text:p>

The actual net value of freedom will gradually be disclosed by the rate of interest per hour, which is bid for a scientific token of net value; and this rate,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in turn , will be determined by the true law of supply and de</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this instinctively by measuring the value of money in terms</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of interest per annum , and the value of order in terms of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">taxation per annum , even though the value of our so -called</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot; gold &quot; money fluctuates disastrously, and our taxation is im posed on effort, thus diminishing the very value we are trying to measure. Today we either jockey ourselves or, rather paternally , think it best to jockey others , into the belief that</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">value rests most safely on gold . We should realize that what</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">we now call economic value is thwarted freedom due to partial</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">order ; and unless we further delude ourselves, we must realize</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that such order as we have is largely paid for by those who benefit least, owing to the fact that we concern ourselves po</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">litically only with the most loudly protested symptoms of dis order ; and still resent, most regally, any attempt to question</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">value of freedom per unit of time, then in the long run (if we do not grow weary of freedom ), the rate of interest is</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">terms of resistance. On the other hand , the layman &apos;s contention that interest is a vicious toll on effort is equally unjustified. If total national economic value is Effort multiplied by Conductivity (or</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Effort - ) , then all value which is unconsumed becomes Resistance</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as it should be, then it would reflect both these qualities; and , naturally enough, we would get the phenomena of valid capital and valid interest.

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">an unrelated arbitrary. It represents too much value, in which case we get high interest rates and a &quot; panic &quot; ; or it represents</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">By the same logic it may be strongly maintained that the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">equally vexed question of interest-rate would also settle itself. Interest becomes simply the current value of freedom , officially</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">erly coupled by the currency -issuing authority . Under such a system , with our vast store of basic economic value made apparent and subject to mobilization, it would be a little diffi cult to imagine call-money commanding 125 per cent interest, as we have seen happen during a panic while at the expense of</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">At the outset, the annual government charge for the certifica tion and underwriting of value might properly be the same</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">as the Federal tax rate on land-area, since the value certified rests wholly upon the insurance of order . Without any question</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the Treasury rate should be less than the open market interest</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">rate for the certification of credit, as it is obvious that actuality</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">offers better security than belief. The annual charge paid to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the community for this underwriting and certification (which</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">now without any justification is remitted to the owner of gold )</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would make a very substantial contribution to taxation or the cost of order, as it properly should . But this charge for order</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">would fall where it belongs, namely, upon the owner of area who desired to make an advantageous use of order. Today, we find an alien owner of gold receiving his certificate free of</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">charge, while the American farmer who controls a large share</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of the actuality has to pay from 7 to 10 per cent for his cer tificates, as well as most of the cost of order. We carry our</text:p>

In this par tially formed tenuous system for conducting human energy</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">all the vital differences of potential exist to ensure flow and counter-flow ; but the circuit is not yet closed, for bankers have to be cautious.

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">THERE are other points to be considered which bear upon</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the remedy proposed. These are dealt with briefly as follows :</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Incidence of Taxation</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Under the proposed plan the whole burden of taxation falls</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">on land-area as truly valued by population. It is not a tax levied by a temperamental or venal appraiser upon the improved value of land measured in terms of fluctuating dollars: it is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">a tax based upon the occupancy -value of land -area, measured scientifically by local population -density .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">By anticipating the inevitable inflation with which we are</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">faced, we can minimize the dislocation due to a sudden change</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of method. For the first year there would be no taxation whatever. We propose frankly to live for one year upon our</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">newly validated credit, just as we boldly went to war. For</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the second year, on the basis of a total area of 1,903,215,360 acres, the average tax, with a 10 billion dollar budget, would be approximately $ 5 .00 per acre. Since the average density</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of population is i person per 18 acres, this would mean a tax</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of about 14 cents per acre in certain areas in the West where</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the population-density is i person per square mile and a tax of about $ 14,600 per acre in the center of New York City</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">where the population -density is 103,823 per square mile.2 Since the incidence of Federal taxation would bear equally upon all similarly populated land-area , there would be no ques</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">individual land-ownership unprofitable beyond a rational limit, throws open to every citizen the opportunity of owning land . The citizen then should register his citizenship in land, as all good citizens would if they could . He should proclaim his franchise, patent his sovereignty and by the same act admit his</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">pro rata responsibility. This ensures the essential conditions of</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">it will probably be so nearly reached with the provision of eco</text:p>

Such an army, always existing in skeleton form , and increased or diminished as circumstances dictated , would stand ready to step into the breach in case of any exterior political menace . A fair wage, in unimpairable units worth saving (and at a rate which ensured a margin to save) , would eliminate all pos sibility of coercion. Such organizations as these should take the place of our present idle Federal Army and our largely ornamental State Militias. We can afford to pay such pro posed armies generously, for we have ahead of us a long neglected but most inspiring and advantageous campaign. The country cries out for highways, our waters run uselessly to sea, and our forests, guarded foolishly against private use , are turning into jungles for lack of clearing and replanting.

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Exemption As far as this very unpleasant feature of our present eco nomic disorder is concerned , we are involved in no new de parture. Exemption has become very fashionable among the well-to -do : we propose, with one logical exception, to make it universal, and apply it to effort, thrift and consumption in any form they appear, henceforward imposing all taxation upon con trol of value in proportion to the basic economic value con trolled . Exemption for the owner of idle capital is obviously a bar to progress: the agents of progress are seduced . But if we reverse our present procedure and offer exemption where it will serve as an inducement to effort, we shall score a gain</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">instead of a loss. In the case of our most important citizen ,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the average human being who does his day&apos;s work , dreaming only of a bare security against want, exemption would be a simple act of justice. If it is pointed out that under the pro posed system the ultimate burden will fall upon him through rents and the other charges based upon the control of land area , the reply is that we recognize this and safeguard him by a basic government wage calculated upon these very charges.</text:p>

And, apart from his guaranty of a decent wage from the government, there is going to be a demand for his services which will force the government to recruit far more energetically than ever it did during times of less profitable warfare. Both manufac turer and landlord will be compelled to enter the market for human effort. The manufacturer, released from all taxation , and ensured</text:p>

Miles, Chairman of the Fair Tariff League, Racine, Wis consin , in testifying before the Committee on Finance of the United States Senate on January 23rd , 1922, states as follows:</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot; Contrast these facts with the tariff attitude of the hosiery and knit goods people. One of their typical representatives declares that they</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">cannot exist without a further increase in their tariff, because, says he, average wages in the United States in this industry are $ 30 per</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">week , in England $ 17.40 per week , in Germany $ 5 .50, in France $ 7 .14 .</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Were he to tell the truth , he would say that the wage cost per dozen pairs in the United States is about 2 cents per pair on socks and twice</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">that on women&apos;s silk hose of ordinary quality , and correspondingly more for &apos;full-fashioned. He pays this ; he does not pay $ 30 per week ,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">nor does any country pay less than he does per pair. That is why one</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">fourth of all the hosiery and knit goods made in the United States is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">exported the world over ; that is why we exported hosiery last year to</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the amount of $ 4,000,000 and imported only $ 1,000,000, the imports being</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">mostly novelties, golf stockings, etc ., that we did not care to make.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">That is why our knit goods of all sorts go freely all over the world and substantially no knit underwear is imported but only fancy novelties for outer wear.&quot;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">He stated further : &quot; The story of hosiery is repeated in almost every other industry.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot; I have here from the National Acme Co. a piece of metal 372 inches</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">in diameter and 4 or more inches long cut inside and out into difficult shapes. It would take a skilled man a day or two at a forge to make</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">this. Now a man runs 15 machines, each making one of these in two</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">minutes, so the man averages 7 per minute. It would be difficult to figure the wage cost, and yet he gets 50 to 70 cents per hour. This man</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">does the work of 500 men at hand forges in the olden days. The cost</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">to - day is 2 cents per piece ; that was once $ 5 or $ 10 . And yet the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">overgreedy and dissimulating tariff beneficiary will compare the $ 4.50 to $5.50 per day that the American workmen earn at 2 cents per piece</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">with wages in other countries where the net cost is higher.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">&quot;Here are other difficult but smaller pieces. Figure the labor on these. One man runs 15 machines, thereby averaging 7 pieces per second.&quot; Also : &quot; It seems to us pertinent to note that some of our own domestic manu facturers have in the past sold their goods at 30 , 40, 50 and rarely 60 per cent less price to the foreign consumer than to the American con</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">varied agricultural production such as we have not dreamed of heretofore. It is a logical contention that such a change</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">A CONCRETE remedy to conform to the apparently abstract diagnosis put forward has been asked for and tendered. It is tentative, as far as actual figures are concerned, owing to our present statistical chaos; but it is assured and precise when it deals with census-area-order units, the logical measure of value under democracy. While it may appear abstract, this is</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">only because of the shadowsof tradition which still fall across</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the reader &apos;s mind. To speak bluntly , it will appear abstract in</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">proportion to the reader&apos; s willingness to ignore the absurdities and cruelties of our presentmaladjustment which is continually defrauding the helpless, and baffling those normal citizens whose instinct is toward creation and production , while it en</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">riches a few others who, without effort and without con</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sciousness of shame, live richly because of our retarded</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">activities.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">If such steps as have been suggested could be taken to ensure order and freedom , and guard against the unjust depredations of secondary taxation , the sharp fluctuations, and the ulti mate dilution of our pledge of &quot; value,&quot; which takes place be fore our bewildered eyes, we would then , for the first time in human history, within organized society, be face to face with the possibility of actual individual liberty.</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Our vaunted democracy is no more than the raising of the</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">standard of Freedom over a region of economic disorder. The exterior manipulation and the gross interior maladjustment</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">from which we suffer are both largely unrealized , and con</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">sequently all the more difficult to deal with . With maladjustment corrected and manipulation barred , the economic circuit would at last be thrown open and we could commence an era of unrestricted flow , of valid calculation and of accelerating production. It is even possible that in the</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">It must be remembered that the proposals put forward do not involve any miracle, beyond that of opening the eyes of</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">the blind who still believe in the miracle of a valid token of</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">commodity . There is no plan contemplated by which involved capital is declared to be community property, neither is there</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">any dream of creating value and handing it to the state. If value is disclosed, it is at least handed to the present owners,</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2">together with its pro rata responsibility . Neither is there any</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">assumption that there is such a thing as an &quot; unearned incre</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">our present economic chaos, there is an unrealized increment;</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">and,what ismuch more important to dwell on , is that with sane</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">adjustment there is an earnable increment beyond our dreams. Some clamor will arise , as has been pointed out, by those</text:p>

   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">of these tokens. They will be told , with some crispness, to be</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">content with their vouchers ; for, at the first hint of their out cry, the gold will have flown to London , Madrid , Buenos Aires,</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2"/>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">Zurich or The Hague, and only the more ignorantly -held</text:p>
   <text:p text:style-name="P2">residue will be locked up in Washington until the actual owners of gold in mass have picked up all the fruit shaken from the trees, and it is safe again to announce proudly that &quot; the gold</text:p>

Leaving detail for the sake of a larger view , the change in our basis of measurement, from gold to census-area , would eliminate a very dangerously contracted passageway in our arteries of flow . This passageway is permitted to remain con</text:p>
